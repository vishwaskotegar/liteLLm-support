# Plugins

Plugins let external services appear as selectable modes in the LiteLLM UI sidebar alongside the AI Gateway. Each plugin runs as its own backend; LiteLLM proxies requests to it, injects a scoped credential, and hands the iframe a short-lived identity claim so the user never re-authenticates.

This is useful when you want to ship an internal tool (a reporting UI, an agent control plane, a data labelling app) under the LiteLLM dashboard without leaking the caller's master key to that tool.

Selecting a plugin replaces the AI Gateway navigation with the plugin's own; the page below is an Agent Control Plane plugin loaded inside the LiteLLM dashboard frame.

## Quick start

### 1. Register the plugin in `config.yaml`

```yaml
general_settings:
  master_key: os.environ/LITELLM_MASTER_KEY
  plugins:
    - name: my-plugin              # unique identifier, no spaces
      display_name: My Plugin      # label shown in the UI dropdown
      url: "https://my-plugin.example.com"
      plugin_key: "sk-plugin-..."  # plugin's own auth credential
```

`plugin_key` is injected as `Authorization: Bearer <plugin_key>` on every request the proxy forwards to the plugin. The caller's LiteLLM credential is stripped first so the plugin never receives a live LiteLLM API key.

You can also add plugins through the dashboard at **Admin Settings > Plugins**. The same fields apply; `plugin_key` is write-only and never returned by the API once saved.

### 2. Implement the two plugin endpoints

The plugin service must expose two public endpoints. `GET /api/plugin-manifest` returns plugin metadata that the LiteLLM UI uses to render the sidebar, and `POST /api/plugin-auth` decrypts the identity claim that LiteLLM hands the iframe so the user does not sign in twice.

A minimal manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "display_name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "nav_items": [
    { "key": "home",    "label": "Home",    "icon": "HomeOutlined",    "path": "/" },
    { "key": "reports", "label": "Reports", "icon": "BarChartOutlined", "path": "/reports" }
  ],
  "capabilities": ["reports", "data"]
}
```

For `POST /api/plugin-auth`, the iframe forwards a `session_claim` ciphertext. The proxy never shares `LITELLM_SALT_KEY` with the plugin; instead, each plugin is provisioned with its own dedicated key, derived as `HMAC-SHA256(LITELLM_SALT_KEY, plugin_name)`. Compute it once on the proxy host and hand the result to your plugin as a secret (for example, as `PLUGIN_AUTH_KEY`):

```bash
python -c 'import base64,hmac,hashlib,os; \
print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(hmac.new(os.environ["LITELLM_SALT_KEY"].encode(), b"my-plugin", hashlib.sha256).digest()).decode())'
```

A compromised plugin holding only this scoped key cannot recover `LITELLM_SALT_KEY` or decrypt any other LiteLLM secret.

Decrypt and validate the claim in the plugin:

```python
import json, os, time
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

_CLAIM_TTL_SECONDS = 30

def plugin_auth(session_claim: str) -> dict:
    cipher = Fernet(os.environ["PLUGIN_AUTH_KEY"].encode())
    claim = json.loads(cipher.decrypt(session_claim.encode(), ttl=_CLAIM_TTL_SECONDS))
    if claim.get("plugin") != "my-plugin":
        raise ValueError("claim audience mismatch")
    if int(claim.get("exp", 0)) < int(time.time()):
        raise ValueError("claim expired")
    return claim
```

The claim payload is `{ "plugin", "user_id", "user_role", "exp" }`. It carries no LiteLLM bearer token. Establish the plugin's own session from `user_id` and `user_role`, and authenticate API calls back to LiteLLM through the `/plugin-proxy/<name>/*` reverse proxy, which injects `plugin_key` for you.

## What the plugin receives about the user

LiteLLM forwards a deliberately minimal user context. The plugin never sees the caller's email, key alias, team, budget, or bearer token; only an identifier and a role.

The decrypted `session_claim` payload contains exactly four fields:

```json
{
  "plugin": "my-plugin",
  "user_id": "user_abc123",
  "user_role": "proxy_admin",
  "exp": 1750460400
}
```

`plugin` is the plugin name the claim was issued for. Always check that it matches your own plugin before trusting the rest, so a claim for one plugin cannot be replayed against another. `user_id` is the LiteLLM internal user identifier of the caller; use it as the stable join key against LiteLLM's `/user/info` if you need to look up profile data. `user_role` is the caller's LiteLLM role string (for example `proxy_admin`, `internal_user`, or `internal_user_viewer`); use it as a coarse authorization hint, then enforce your own checks. `exp` is a Unix timestamp set 30 seconds in the future; the Fernet `ttl` argument already rejects expired ciphertexts, but verifying `exp` independently catches clock skew between the proxy and the plugin.

Both `user_id` and `user_role` default to `""` when the proxy could not resolve them (for example, an unauthenticated caller). Treat empty strings as unauthenticated; do not grant elevated access on a missing role.

On every `/plugin-proxy/<name>/<path>` call the proxy makes to the plugin's backend, the same identity is forwarded as two headers:

```
x-litellm-user-id: user_abc123
x-litellm-user-role: proxy_admin
```

These headers are informational. The plugin should still authenticate the request against its own session (issued from a verified `session_claim`), not from headers it cannot independently verify.

## How iframe auth works

```
LiteLLM UI
  GET /api/plugins/auth-token        -> { session_claim }
  postMessage({ type:"litellm-auth", session_claim }, pluginOrigin)
       |
       v
Plugin iframe (browser)
  POST /api/plugin-auth { session_claim }
       |
       v
Plugin server
  decrypt(session_claim, PLUGIN_AUTH_KEY) -> { user_id, user_role, exp }
  establish plugin session -> stored in sessionStorage
```

No LiteLLM bearer token ever leaves the proxy. The claim only conveys the caller's identity and expires after 30 seconds, so a `postMessage` intercept yields ciphertext that is useless without the plugin's scoped key.

## Proxy routes

`GET /api/plugins` lists the registered plugins, returning `name`, `display_name`, and `url` for each. `plugin_key` is never returned; it stays server-side. The caller must be authenticated.

`GET /api/plugins/auth-token?plugin_name=<name>` returns a short-lived encrypted identity claim for the named plugin. It requires `LITELLM_SALT_KEY` to be set on the proxy (responds 503 otherwise) and the plugin to be registered (404 otherwise).

`ANY /plugin-proxy/{name}/{path}` is the authenticated reverse proxy to the plugin backend. Access is restricted to `proxy_admin`.

## Reverse proxy behaviour

When an admin (or a server-to-server caller) hits `/plugin-proxy/<name>/<path>`, the proxy authenticates the caller locally and then rewrites the request before forwarding it to the plugin's `url`.

Every LiteLLM credential header is stripped before forwarding. That includes `Authorization`, `x-api-key`, `API-Key`, `x-goog-api-key`, `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`, `x-litellm-api-key`, any configured `litellm_key_header_name`, and `Cookie`. The plugin can never be handed the caller's live LiteLLM key.

`plugin_key` is then injected as `Authorization: Bearer <plugin_key>`. That is the only credential the plugin receives.

Caller identity is forwarded as `x-litellm-user-id` and `x-litellm-user-role` so the plugin can run its own authorization. These are informational hints, not credentials.

Responses are sandboxed with `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` so plugin-controlled bytes served from the LiteLLM origin cannot execute against the dashboard.

## Security checklist

Before exposing a plugin to your users, confirm that `LITELLM_SALT_KEY` is set on the proxy and is never shared with the plugin, that the plugin holds only its derived `HMAC(LITELLM_SALT_KEY, plugin_name)` key (provisioned as a dedicated secret), and that `plugin_key` is a dedicated credential scoped to the plugin rather than your LiteLLM master key. The plugin's `POST /api/plugin-auth` must enforce both the claim's `plugin` audience and its `exp` (30 second TTL). The plugin should treat `x-litellm-user-id` and `x-litellm-user-role` as identity hints, not as proof of authentication, and the plugin service URL should use HTTPS in production.

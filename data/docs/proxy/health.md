# Health Checks

Two things consume the proxy's health state. Your orchestrator (Kubernetes, a load balancer, an uptime monitor) polls lightweight probe endpoints to decide whether the process is up and ready for traffic. You, the operator, check whether each configured LLM can actually serve requests. This page covers both.

## Probe endpoints

These endpoints answer "is the gateway process up and able to serve traffic?" without making any LLM calls. They are the canonical liveness and readiness contract for the proxy.

| Endpoint | Auth | Returns | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| `GET /health/liveliness` | none | `"I'm alive!"` (200), or `{"status": "shutting_down"}` (503) during graceful shutdown | The process is up. No dependencies are checked. `GET /health/liveness` is an alias with the Kubernetes spelling; both are real routes |
| `GET /health/readiness` | none | `{"status": "healthy", "db": ...}` (200) when ready; 503 when a configured database is unreachable | The worker is ready to accept traffic. The `db` field is `"connected"`, `"disconnected"`, or `"Not connected"` when no database is configured |

The `db` value lets an orchestrator distinguish a healthy worker from one that booted but cannot reach its database. When the database is configured and unreachable, readiness returns 503 so the pod is pulled from rotation.

The default readiness payload is deliberately low-detail so it is safe to expose to unauthenticated probes. For full diagnostics (callbacks, cache, version), either set `general_settings.allow_public_health_readiness_details: true` to expand `/health/readiness` itself, or call the authenticated `GET /health/readiness/details` endpoint.

A minimal Kubernetes probe pair on the proxy's port 4000:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/liveliness
    port: 4000
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/readiness
    port: 4000
```

For full deployment manifests, see the [Production Deployment guide](./deploy.md) and the [production checklist](./prod.md).

## Model health in the Admin UI

The primary way to check whether your models are serving is the Admin UI. Go to Models + Endpoints, open the Health Status tab, and click Run All Checks. Each model shows a status, error details when it fails, and the last check and last success times.

<Image img={require('../../img/ui_health_status.png')} alt="Model Health Status tab showing a healthy model after Run All Checks" />

The API equivalent is `GET /health`, which accepts any valid key. It runs a real test request against every configured model, so it costs a few tokens per model.

```shell
curl --location 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/health' -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY"
```

```json
{
    "healthy_endpoints": [
        {"model": "azure/{{openai_small}}", "api_base": "https://my-endpoint-canada-berri992.openai.azure.com/"}
    ],
    "unhealthy_endpoints": [
        {"model": "azure/{{openai_small}}", "api_base": "https://openai-france-1234.openai.azure.com/"}
    ]
}
```

To check a single model, pass `?model=<model_name>` or `?model_id=<id>`; you can find a model's id from `GET /v1/model/info`.

## Background health checks

By default `/health` probes every model on each call. To avoid querying models too frequently, run the checks in the background and have `/health` serve the last cached result. Configure this in `general_settings`:

```yaml
general_settings:
  background_health_checks: true      # run checks in the background
  health_check_interval: 300          # seconds between runs (default 300)
  health_check_details: true          # include endpoint URLs and errors in the response (default true)
```

Set `health_check_details: false` to strip endpoint URLs, error messages, and other params from the response when the proxy is exposed to a broad audience.

To exclude a model from the background loop, set `disable_background_health_check: true` in its `model_info`. That only skips the background loop; an on-demand `GET /health` still probes it unless you also set `general_settings.health_check_skip_disabled_background_models: true`, which omits those deployments from on-demand and shared health checks as well.

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: openai/{{openai_large}}
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/{{openai_large}}
      api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
    model_info:
      disable_background_health_check: true
```

To scope the background loop to specific model groups instead of excluding models one by one, set `general_settings.background_health_check_model_groups` to the list of model group names to probe. Only deployments in the listed groups are checked, so `/health` reports only those groups, and [health check routing](./health_check_routing.md) applies only to them; unlisted groups keep their configured routing behavior. Model groups added later are not probed until you add them to the list, and a value that is not a list of strings fails at startup

```yaml
general_settings:
  background_health_checks: true
  background_health_check_model_groups: ["prod-openai"]
```

For coordinating checks across multiple pods so expensive models are not probed once per pod, see [Shared Health Check State](./shared_health_check.md).

## Model modes

The health check picks the operation to test from the model's `model_info.mode`. Set it so the probe uses the right API surface; if you leave it unset, LiteLLM auto-detects from the model's capabilities and falls back to a chat completion.

| `mode` | Health check calls |
|--------|--------------------|
| `chat` (default) | `/chat/completions` |
| `completion` | `/completions` |
| `embedding` | `/embeddings` |
| `image_generation` | image generation |
| `audio_transcription` | audio transcription |
| `audio_speech` | text to speech (requires `health_check_voice`) |
| `rerank` | rerank |
| `batch` | batch (Azure only) |
| `realtime` | realtime session |
| `ocr` | OCR |
| `video_generation` | video generation |
| `image_edit` | image edit |

For a wildcard route (`*` in `litellm_params.model`), set `health_check_model` to the concrete model the probe should call. With `mode` unset on a wildcard route, `max_tokens` is left unset on the probe request.

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: azure-embedding-model
    litellm_params:
      model: azure/azure-embedding-model
      api_base: os.environ/AZURE_API_BASE
      api_key: os.environ/AZURE_API_KEY
      api_version: "2023-07-01-preview"
    model_info:
      mode: embedding
```

## Health check tuning reference

Set these under a model's `model_info` unless noted otherwise. They control how the probe request is shaped.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `health_check_timeout` | 60s | Per-model timeout for the probe |
| `health_check_max_tokens` | 16 (unset for wildcard routes) | `max_tokens` on the probe request |
| `health_check_max_tokens_reasoning` | unset | `max_tokens` for reasoning models when `health_check_max_tokens` is not set |
| `health_check_max_tokens_non_reasoning` | unset | `max_tokens` for non-reasoning models when `health_check_max_tokens` is not set |
| `health_check_reasoning_effort` | unset | `reasoning_effort` on the probe (chat, completion, batch, responses modes only) |
| `health_check_voice` | `alloy` | Voice for `audio_speech` probes |
| `health_check_model` | unset | Concrete model a wildcard route probes |
| `disable_background_health_check` | false | Skip this model in the background loop |

Reasoning models often need a higher probe `max_tokens` because providers count reasoning tokens toward the completion budget; the separate reasoning and non-reasoning keys let you raise it without listing every model. Three environment variables set global defaults: `DEFAULT_HEALTH_CHECK_PROMPT` overrides the default probe prompt (`"test from litellm"`), `BACKGROUND_HEALTH_CHECK_MAX_TOKENS` is the global `max_tokens` fallback, and `BACKGROUND_HEALTH_CHECK_MAX_TOKENS_REASONING` takes precedence for non-wildcard reasoning models.

To route traffic away from deployments that fail health checks, see [Health Check Driven Routing](./health_check_routing.md).

## Other health endpoints

All of these require a valid key unless noted.

- `GET /health/services?service=<name>` tests a configured alerting or logging service (datadog, slack, langfuse, and so on); accepts any valid key
- `GET /health/readiness/details` returns the authenticated readiness diagnostics (db, cache, callbacks, version)
- `GET /health/history` returns past health check results
- `GET /health/latest` returns the most recent health check result
- `GET /health/backlog` returns the number of in-flight requests on the worker
- `GET /health/drain` starts a graceful drain for Kubernetes `preStop` hooks; disabled by default (404) unless `general_settings.enable_drain_endpoint: true`, and gated by the `X-Drain-Token` header when `DRAIN_ENDPOINT_TOKEN` is set

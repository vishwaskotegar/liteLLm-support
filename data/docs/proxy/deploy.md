# Production Deployment

Production deployment guide for AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or any Kubernetes cluster. For a first deployment on a single machine, start with the [Quickstart](./docker_quick_start.md); this page picks up where it ends.

There are two supported paths. If you run Kubernetes, [deploy with Helm](#deploy-with-helm) on EKS, GKE, or AKS; the install is the same on every cloud, only the data stores and ingress differ. If you do not run Kubernetes, AWS and GCP have [official Terraform modules](#deploy-with-terraform-aws-and-gcp) that stand up the entire stack; Azure has no Terraform module, so AKS with Helm is the supported path there.

## Architecture

<CloudArchitectureSelector />

LiteLLM provides two deployment modes:

- **Monolithic**: one `litellm` image serves LLM traffic, management APIs, and the UI. This is what the `litellm-helm` chart runs, and the simplest to operate.
- **Microservices**: a `gateway` (LLM traffic, port 4000), `backend` (management APIs and UI backend, port 4001), and `ui` (port 3000), each deployed and scaled independently. This is what the componentized `litellm` chart and both Terraform modules run; see the [chart values](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/helm/litellm/values.yaml) for the full reference.

The supporting infrastructure is identical in either mode:

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LiteLLM services | One proxy deployment (monolithic) or gateway + backend + ui (microservices) | Stateless; run 2+ replicas behind a load balancer |
| PostgreSQL | Keys, teams, users, spend logs, config | Required for the proxy's auth and tracking features |
| Redis | Rate limiting, router state, caching across instances | Required once you run more than one instance |
| Migrations job | Applies schema migrations against Postgres | Runs once per upgrade; proxy instances set `DISABLE_SCHEMA_UPDATE=true` |

## Core configuration

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/litellm"
LITELLM_MASTER_KEY="sk-..."   # admin key for the proxy
LITELLM_SALT_KEY="sk-..."     # encrypts provider credentials stored in the DB. Set once, never change it
DISABLE_SCHEMA_UPDATE="true"  # proxy instances never run migrations; the migrations job does
STORE_MODEL_IN_DB="True"      # manage models from the Admin UI instead of config files
```

`LITELLM_SALT_KEY` cannot be rotated after you add models: it encrypts the provider credentials stored in your database, and changing it makes them unreadable. Generate a strong random value and store both keys in your cloud's secret manager.

Official images are published to `ghcr.io/berriai` and mirrored at `docker.litellm.ai/berriai`. Use `ghcr.io/berriai/litellm` for monolithic deployments, including those with Postgres, since it bundles the Prisma toolchain, and pin a version tag rather than `latest` or a moving tag, so rollbacks are deterministic. All images are signed; see the [Docker Image Security Guide](./docker_image_security.md) for verification and the non-root variant.

## Provision the data stores

The Helm path needs a PostgreSQL database and a Redis reachable from your cluster. Use the managed services:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS">

Provision [RDS PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html) and [ElastiCache Redis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/WhatIs.html) in the same VPC as your EKS cluster, with security groups permitting the cluster's nodes on ports 5432 and 6379.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gcp" label="Google Cloud">

Provision [Cloud SQL PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres) and [Memorystore Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis) with private IPs on the VPC your GKE cluster uses (Cloud SQL needs [Private Services Access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-services-access)). Use the instances' private IPs as the endpoints below.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="azure" label="Azure">

```bash
az group create --name litellm-prod --location eastus

az aks create --resource-group litellm-prod --name litellm-aks \
  --node-count 3 --enable-managed-identity

az postgres flexible-server create --resource-group litellm-prod \
  --name litellm-db --database-name litellm \
  --tier GeneralPurpose --sku-name Standard_D2ds_v5

az redis create --resource-group litellm-prod --name litellm-redis \

```

Docs: [AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/what-is-aks), [Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/overview), [Azure Cache for Redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview). Azure Cache for Redis serves TLS on port 6380, and TLS is enabled through the URL scheme: instead of `redis_host` and `redis_port`, set `redis_url: "rediss://:<access-key>@litellm-redis.redis.cache.windows.net:6380"` under `router_settings` (the `rediss://` scheme turns TLS on).

## Deploy with Helm

First create the secrets both charts consume:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic litellm-masterkey \
  --from-literal=masterkey="sk-$(openssl rand -hex 24)"

kubectl create secret generic litellm-db \
  --from-literal=username=litellm \
  --from-literal=password="<database-password>"

kubectl create secret generic litellm-env \
  --from-literal=LITELLM_SALT_KEY="sk-$(openssl rand -hex 24)" \
  --from-literal=REDIS_PASSWORD="<redis-password>" \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY="<provider-key>"
```

Then pick a deployment mode:

    redis_password: os.environ/REDIS_PASSWORD
```

```bash
helm install litellm oci://ghcr.io/berriai/litellm-helm -f values.yaml
```

The chart lives at [`helm/litellm-helm`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/tree/main/helm/litellm-helm); the published chart versions carry LiteLLM release numbers (for example `1.90.2`), and `helm show values oci://ghcr.io/berriai/litellm-helm` lists every knob. Beyond the values above it supports [autoscaling](#autoscaling) (`autoscaling.*` or `keda.*`), PodDisruptionBudgets (`pdb.*`), a Prometheus ServiceMonitor (`serviceMonitor.*`), read replica routing (`db.readReplicaUrl`, see [Database Read Replica](./db_read_replica.md)), graceful drain on shutdown (`lifecycle`), ArgoCD or Helm hooks for the migrations job (`migrationJob.hooks.*`, see [Helm PreSync hooks](./prod.md#run-migrations-from-the-helm-presync-hook)), and an optional [dedicated Prometheus metrics listener](./prometheus.md#isolate-prometheus-scraping-from-inference-traffic) configured through `metricsServer.*`.

```bash
helm upgrade --install litellm \

  --version 1.89.2 \
  -f values.yaml
```

This deploys `gateway`, `backend`, and `ui` as separate services. You can scale the gateway for inference traffic without scaling the management API or Admin UI. The chart requires external Postgres and Redis and supports database read replicas, IAM database authentication, Redis Cluster, per-component probes, and per-component autoscaling.

Pin the chart to `1.89.0` or newer. Each component image tag defaults to the chart version. See the [chart values](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/helm/litellm/values.yaml) for every option, [Autoscaling](#autoscaling) for scaling configuration, and [Prometheus metrics isolation](./prometheus.md#isolate-prometheus-scraping-from-inference-traffic) for the gateway metrics sidecar.

The [high-throughput deployment profile](./high_throughput.md) adds shared database connections, isolated spend processing, and RPS/TPS autoscaling. This profile is currently available in nightly builds.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Both charts run the migrations job automatically and keep `DISABLE_SCHEMA_UPDATE=true` on the proxy pods. Expose the service through your cloud's ingress: the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html) on EKS, [GKE Ingress](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress) on GKE, or [Application Gateway Ingress (AGIC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-overview) on AKS, with health checks on `/health/readiness`, then point your DNS record at the resulting load balancer. For secrets, prefer your cloud's secret manager over plain Kubernetes secrets ([Key Vault CSI driver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-driver) on AKS, for example); the charts consume whatever secret you mount.

### Autoscaling

Both charts can scale themselves, and both ship autoscaling off or conservative by default. For the thresholds to aim at, and why memory is not one of them, see [autoscaling in the production checklist](./prod.md#autoscaling).

`litellm-helm` offers two mutually exclusive mechanisms. `autoscaling.*` renders a standard HorizontalPodAutoscaler, and `keda.*` renders a KEDA `ScaledObject` for scaling on queue depth, Prometheus queries, or anything else KEDA can read. Enabling both renders only the HPA, so pick one.

```yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: false
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 100
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  # targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage and behavior are also accepted

keda:
  enabled: false
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 100
  pollingInterval: 30   # seconds between trigger evaluations
  cooldownPeriod: 300   # seconds of quiet before scaling back to minReplicas
  triggers: []          # required; a ScaledObject with no triggers will not scale
```

`keda.triggers` is empty by default and has no useful default, so supply the trigger yourself; the chart's `values.yaml` carries a commented Prometheus example. `keda.fallback`, `keda.behavior`, and `keda.restoreToOriginalReplicaCount` are passed through for controlling what happens when the metric source is unavailable and how replicas settle after a scale event.

The componentized chart scales each component on its own, under `gateway.hpa`, `backend.hpa`, and `ui.hpa`. The gateway and backend autoscale out of the box and the UI does not, with maximums sized to the shape of each component's traffic: the gateway defaults to `maxReplicas: 10` at 70 percent CPU and 80 percent memory, the backend to `maxReplicas: 4` at 70 percent CPU, and the UI to `maxReplicas: 3` at 80 percent CPU with `enabled: false`. Raising the gateway's ceiling is usually all you need, since it is the only component that sees LLM traffic.

Whichever mechanism you use, set the maximum against what your database can serve. The connection pool is per worker, so the ceiling on replicas is also a ceiling on Postgres connections; `litellm-helm` defaults `maxReplicas` to 100, which at the default pool limit of 10 asks for roughly 1000 connections at full scale-out. See [bounding database connections](./prod.md#bound-database-connections).

#### Scale on requests and tokens per pod

CPU lags LLM traffic: a pod streaming forty responses is mostly waiting on providers, so its CPU stays low while its capacity is gone. Both charts can scale on the two counters the proxy already exports, `litellm_proxy_total_requests_metric_total` and `litellm_total_tokens_metric_total`, expressed as requests per second (RPS) and tokens per second (TPS) per pod, the way load is usually quoted (1k rps, 75M tok/s). The targets are opt-in and empty by default, so nothing changes until you set one, and they sit next to the CPU and memory targets: an HPA follows whichever metric asks for the most replicas. `averageValue` is a Kubernetes quantity, so `"6M"` and `"6000000"` are the same tokens per second.

```yaml
# litellm-helm
autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  targetRequestsPerSecond: "90"
  targetTokensPerSecond: "6M"
metricsServer:
  enabled: true
serviceMonitor:
  enabled: true

# componentized chart
gateway:
  metricsServer:
    enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
  hpa:
    targetRequestsPerSecond: "90"
    targetTokensPerSecond: "6M"
```

Each target renders an `autoscaling/v2` `Pods` metric, `litellm_requests_per_second` or `litellm_tokens_per_second`, with an `AverageValue` target. Kubernetes cannot read Prometheus by itself, so two things have to be in place. The chart's ServiceMonitor (Prometheus Operator) scrapes every pod on its own so each sample carries the `pod` label. Turn on the dedicated metrics listener with it (`gateway.metricsServer.enabled` on the componentized chart, `metricsServer.enabled` on `litellm-helm`): the main port serves `/metrics/` behind virtual-key auth and answers an unauthenticated scrape with 401, so the componentized chart refuses to render a ServiceMonitor without it. Then a [Prometheus Adapter](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter) has to serve those two names on `custom.metrics.k8s.io`, grouped by pod. `rate()` already returns a per-second value, so there is no `* 60`:

```yaml
rules:
  - seriesQuery: 'litellm_proxy_total_requests_metric_total{namespace!="",pod!=""}'
    resources: { overrides: { namespace: { resource: namespace }, pod: { resource: pod } } }
    name: { as: litellm_requests_per_second }
    metricsQuery: sum(rate(<<.Series>>{<<.LabelMatchers>>}[1m])) by (<<.GroupBy>>)
  - seriesQuery: 'litellm_total_tokens_metric_total{namespace!="",pod!=""}'
    resources: { overrides: { namespace: { resource: namespace }, pod: { resource: pod } } }
    name: { as: litellm_tokens_per_second }
    metricsQuery: sum(rate(<<.Series>>{<<.LabelMatchers>>}[1m])) by (<<.GroupBy>>)
```

The unit is a constant factor and does not make the HPA react any faster. What sets the lag is the `rate()` window in the adapter rule, the scrape interval, and the HPA sync period (15s by default). Keep the window at `[1m]` and the ServiceMonitor interval at the chart default of 15s or faster so the window always holds at least four samples: after a traffic step the signal moves on the next scrape and reaches its full value 60s later, where a `[2m]` window is still at half.

Both counters are split by model, key, and team labels, so the `sum by (pod)` folds a pod's series into one number. `kubectl get --raw /apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/<ns>/pods/*/litellm_tokens_per_second` shows what the HPA sees. Worked example: 1,000 rps across 10 gateway pods is 100 rps per pod against a target of 90, so the HPA asks for `ceil(10 * 100 / 90) = 12` replicas. The token metric does the same arithmetic: ten pods serving 70,000,000 tokens per second between them average 7,000,000 TPS against a target of 6,000,000, so `ceil(10 * 7000000 / 6000000) = 12`.

Tokens are counted when a response finishes, so a long stream shows up in TPS only once it completes. RPS reacts first and TPS catches up, which is fine for scale-out but means a burst of long streams is under-counted for as long as they run. Do not set a TPS target alone if your traffic is dominated by multi-minute streams.

On `litellm-helm` the same signals are available through KEDA without an adapter. `keda.prometheus.requestsPerSecond` and `keda.prometheus.tokensPerSecond` are the load one replica should carry, and each adds a Prometheus trigger on `sum(rate(<counter>{namespace="<release namespace>",job="<release>-metrics"}[1m]))`, selected by release namespace and the `job` label the chart's ServiceMonitor produces. KEDA divides the release-wide rate by the per-replica threshold to pick the replica count, so the result matches the HPA path for the same traffic. Keep `keda.pollingInterval` at 15s or lower for the same reason as the scrape interval above.

```yaml
keda:
  enabled: true
  prometheus:
    serverAddress: http://prometheus-operated.monitoring.svc:9090
    requestsPerSecond: "90"
    tokensPerSecond: "6000000"
metricsServer:
  enabled: true
serviceMonitor:
  enabled: true
```

On AWS ECS the Terraform module takes the same per-second inputs, `gateway_target_requests_per_second` on `ALBRequestCountPerTarget` and `gateway_target_tokens_per_second` once you publish the token counter to CloudWatch, and converts them itself because the ALB publishes a per-minute count. CloudWatch target tracking aggregates every metric over 60-second periods with no period setting, so ECS reacts on a roughly one-minute cadence whatever the unit; the [module README](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/terraform/litellm/aws/README.md#scaling-the-gateway-on-requests-and-tokens) covers both policies. Cloud Run scales on request concurrency and has no custom-metric input, so there is no TPS path on GCP outside GKE.

### Kubernetes without Helm

If you manage raw manifests, the equivalent deployment is a ConfigMap for `config.yaml`, a Secret for keys, a Deployment with health probes, and a Service.

## Deploy with Terraform (AWS and GCP)

The official modules deploy the full microservices stack (network, database, Redis, object storage, secrets, compute, load balancer, and a migrations job that runs before the services start) and are published to the Terraform Registry:

- [`BerriAI/litellm/aws`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/BerriAI/litellm/aws/latest)
- [`BerriAI/litellm/google`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/BerriAI/litellm/google/latest)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS (ECS Fargate)">

By default, provisions a VPC with public and private subnets, an Aurora PostgreSQL cluster (writer plus reader, IAM database auth), ElastiCache Redis (multi-AZ, encrypted), an S3 bucket, Secrets Manager entries, an Application Load Balancer, and ECS Fargate services. The networking and both data stores are optional, so you can reuse what your account already runs; see below.

```hcl title="main.tf"
module "litellm" {
  source  = "BerriAI/litellm/aws"
  version = "~> 1.90"

  region = "us-east-1"
  azs    = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
  tenant = "acme"
  env    = "prod"

  ui_password         = var.ui_password
  litellm_license     = var.litellm_license      # optional, omit for open source
  acm_certificate_arn = var.acm_certificate_arn  # TLS is required by default

  proxy_config = {
    model_list = [{
      model_name = "{{openai_large}}"
      litellm_params = {
        model   = "openai/{{openai_large}}"
        api_key = "os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY"
      }
    }]
  }
  gateway_extra_secrets = {
    OPENAI_API_KEY = var.openai_key_secret_arn
  }
}
```

Before you apply: provision the TLS certificate in [AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) (the module refuses a plaintext ALB unless you explicitly set `allow_plaintext_alb = true`), and create any provider-key secrets in [Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html) first, since `gateway_extra_secrets` takes their ARNs. After apply, point your DNS record at the ALB hostname.

The module auto-generates the master key into Secrets Manager if you do not supply one. The application connects to Aurora with short-lived IAM tokens, so its `DATABASE_URL` carries no password (the database master password itself is generated into Secrets Manager and never touches the application). Every resource is named `<tenant>-litellm-<env>`, and the module declares no provider, so you can `for_each` it to run one stack per tenant.

**Bringing your own VPC, database, or Redis.** The networking and both data stores are each optional, so you can deploy into infrastructure your account already has. This is the path to take when your guardrails only allow workloads inside a pre-approved VPC, or when a separate team owns the Postgres and Redis you are expected to use. Set only the pieces you want to reuse; anything you leave at its default is still created for you.

```hcl title="main.tf"
module "litellm" {
  source  = "BerriAI/litellm/aws"
  version = "~> 1.90"

  region = "us-east-1"
  tenant = "acme"
  env    = "prod"

  # Existing networking. Drop `azs` when you set these: no VPC, subnets,
  # route tables, internet gateway, or NAT gateway are created.
  vpc_id             = "vpc-0123456789abcdef0"
  public_subnet_ids  = ["subnet-aaa", "subnet-bbb"]  # ALB, 2+ AZs
  private_subnet_ids = ["subnet-ccc", "subnet-ddd"]  # tasks and data stores, 2+ AZs

  # Existing data stores. Each URL is stored in Secrets Manager and reaches
  # the containers as DATABASE_URL / REDIS_URL.
  create_database = false
  database_url    = var.database_url
  create_redis    = false
  redis_url       = var.redis_url

  # Attach a group your database already allows, alongside the module's own.
  additional_task_security_group_ids = ["sg-0123456789abcdef0"]
}
```

Your existing stores have to accept traffic from the tasks. The module always creates its own tasks security group and reports it as the `task_security_group_id` output, so either allow that group inbound on the database and Redis, or pass a group they already allow through `additional_task_security_group_ids`. Private subnets you supply also need their own egress, through a NAT gateway or VPC endpoints, since the module creates no routing of its own in this mode. It reaches Secrets Manager, pulls container images, and calls LLM providers from those subnets.

Supply private subnets in at least two availability zones whenever the module still creates Aurora or ElastiCache, since both of their subnet groups require it. One private subnet is accepted only when you have turned both stores off.

Leaving a `create_*` at `false` with an empty URL runs the stack without that component entirely. With no database there is no key management, spend tracking, or UI persistence, so authentication falls back to the master key alone. Without Redis, rate limits, budgets, and router cooldowns are counted per gateway process rather than across the cluster, and the module runs two gateway tasks by default and autoscales to ten, so a caller spread across them receives each process's full allowance. The plan warns when you configure that combination. Hold the gateway to a single process with `gateway_autoscaling_enabled = false`, `gateway_desired_count = 1`, and `gateway_num_workers = 1` if you need per-key limits to mean anything without Redis.

Missing or inconsistent inputs fail during `terraform plan` rather than halfway through an apply, so setting `vpc_id` without the subnet ids, or dropping `azs` without setting `vpc_id`, tells you so before anything is created.

Provisions a VPC with Private Services Access, Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (primary plus read replica), Memorystore Redis with TLS, a GCS bucket, Secret Manager entries, Cloud Run services, and a global HTTPS load balancer with serverless NEGs.

```hcl title="main.tf"
module "litellm" {
  source  = "BerriAI/litellm/google"
  version = "~> 1.90"

  project_id = "my-project"
  region     = "us-central1"
  tenant     = "acme"
  env        = "prod"

  ui_password     = var.ui_password
  litellm_license = var.litellm_license  # optional

  # Cloud Run cannot pull from ghcr.io. Point this at an Artifact Registry
  # remote repository backed by ghcr.io, or mirror the images.
  image_registry = "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/ghcr-remote/berriai"

  lb_domains = ["llm.example.com"]

  proxy_config = {
    model_list = [{
      model_name = "{{gemini_pro}}"
      litellm_params = { model = "vertex_ai/{{gemini_pro}}" }
    }]
  }
}
```

Three GCP-specific caveats. First, always override `image_registry`: it defaults to `ghcr.io/berriai`, which Cloud Run cannot pull from, so the apply succeeds but the services fail at image pull. Point it at an [Artifact Registry remote repository](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/remote-overview) that proxies `ghcr.io`. Second, the database uses password authentication through Secret Manager rather than IAM auth; LiteLLM's IAM token support is AWS RDS specific. Third, create the DNS record for `lb_domains` pointing at the load balancer IP after apply; the [Google-managed certificate](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs) will not finish provisioning until the domain resolves to it.

The AWS module can run Prometheus collection in a dedicated ECS sidecar using `gateway_metrics_port` and restrict access with `gateway_metrics_scrape_cidrs`; see [Isolate Prometheus scraping from inference traffic](./prometheus.md#isolate-prometheus-scraping-from-inference-traffic).

To manage LiteLLM resources (keys, teams, models) as code once the stack is up, use [terraform-provider-litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/terraform-provider-litellm).

## Verify the deployment

Confirm the proxy is up and can reach its database:

```bash
curl -s https://llm.example.com/health/readiness
```

Then open the Admin UI at `https://llm.example.com/ui`, log in with your master key, add a model, create a virtual key, and send a Playground message; a response proves the full path through the load balancer, proxy, database, and provider credentials. The [Quickstart](./docker_quick_start.md#2-log-in-to-the-admin-ui) walks through each of those clicks with screenshots; the flow is identical on a production deployment.

## Next steps

Use the [production checklist](./prod.md) to configure workers, resources, Redis, graceful degradation, and server tuning. Verify images with the [Docker Image Security Guide](./docker_image_security.md). Add regions with [Multi-Region Deployment](./multi_region.md). For workloads above 1,000 RPS, enable the [Redis transaction buffer](./prod.md#redis-transaction-buffer) and evaluate the [high-throughput deployment profile](./high_throughput.md).

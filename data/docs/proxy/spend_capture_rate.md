# Spend Capture Rate

:::info
The spend capture-rate check ships in an upcoming release, so it is not in the current stable version yet
:::

The capture-rate check compares the spend LiteLLM tracked for a provider against what that provider billed for the
same UTC days, and tells you what share of the bill went through LiteLLM:

```
capture_rate = captured_spend / provider_spend
```

A rate of 1.0 means every dollar the provider billed went through LiteLLM and was priced. A rate under 1.0 means
requests are reaching the provider outside LiteLLM (direct API keys, another gateway) or LiteLLM's cost tracking is
dropping spend. A rate over 1.0 means LiteLLM is pricing above the bill

Only OpenAI is wired in this release. LiteLLM's side is the `LiteLLM_DailyUserSpend` table, summed over the
`custom_llm_provider` values `openai` and `text-completion-openai`. OpenAI's side is the
[Organization Costs API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/usage/costs)
(`GET https://api.openai.com/v1/organization/costs` with `bucket_width=1d`), read with an OpenAI Admin API key.
For every other provider the manual comparison in [Debugging a cost discrepancy](../troubleshoot/cost_discrepancy)
is still the recipe

## Setup

Create an Admin API key at
[platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys).
A read-only admin key is enough. Set it on the proxy as `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY`:

```bash
export OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY="sk-admin-..."
```

This key is separate from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` your deployments use. It only reads billing data and never serves a
request. The check also needs the proxy database, since captured spend comes from `LiteLLM_DailyUserSpend`

## Scheduled check

Enable the daily check under `general_settings`:

```yaml
general_settings:
  spend_capture_rate_check:
    providers: ["openai"]        # default ["openai"], the only value today
    threshold: 0.9               # default 0.9, alert when the rate over the window is under it
    lookback_days: 7             # default 7, window is the closed UTC days before today (yesterday back), 1 to 180
    openai_project_ids: []       # optional, scope the OpenAI bill to these project ids; default is the whole organization
```

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `providers` | `["openai"]` | Providers to check. `openai` is the only value today |
| `threshold` | `0.9` | Alert when the rate over the window is under this. Over 0 and at most 1 |
| `lookback_days` | `7` | Closed UTC days to compare, from yesterday back. 1 to 180 |
| `openai_project_ids` | `[]` | OpenAI project ids to scope the bill to. Empty means the whole organization. Captured spend is never scoped, so list every project LiteLLM's OpenAI keys belong to |

An unknown key or an out-of-range value fails proxy boot with a validation error, so a typo never runs as a silent
default. The section is read again right before every run, so a change that arrives through a config reload from the
database applies at the next run without a restart, and an invalid value that arrives that way fails that run with the
same validation error in the proxy log

The job runs every day at 01:15 UTC, and once about two minutes after the proxy boots so that enabling it gives you a
first reading right away. It runs in every worker process of every replica, so each process sets its own Prometheus
gauge. When Redis is configured, a replica whose finished check has something to alert on claims a cross-replica lock
held for 15 minutes, and only the replica that claimed it sends the alert, so a window under the threshold produces
one alert rather than one per worker. A replica whose check failed part way never claims the lock, so it cannot
silence a replica that got through. Without Redis, or when the lock cannot be read, every replica alerts, since a
missed alert costs more than a duplicate

The check publishes the rate to Prometheus and alerts through the proxy's configured [alerting](./alerting) (alert
type `failed_tracking_spend`, level High) when the rate over the window is under the threshold, when
`OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` is not set on the proxy, or when the OpenAI costs API cannot be read. The alert names the rate, the
threshold, the captured and billed dollars, and the date range, and links back to this page

A window where OpenAI billed nothing has no rate: the gauge is set to `NaN` and nothing alerts. A rate above 1.0 is
published but never alerts

## Prometheus gauge

With `litellm_settings.callbacks: ["prometheus"]` set (see [Prometheus metrics](./prometheus)), the scheduled check
publishes one gauge:

| Metric | Labels | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `litellm_spend_capture_rate` | `api_provider` | The rate over the check's window. `NaN` when the last check produced no rate |

Only the scheduled check sets the gauge. The on-demand endpoint below never touches it. A check that produced no rate
(OpenAI billed nothing, `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` is not set, or the costs API could not be read) sets it to `NaN` rather than
leaving the last good value in place, so a stale rate never reads as current. `NaN` compares false in PromQL, so the
rule below stays quiet on it; the missing-key and unreadable-bill cases reach you through the proxy's own alert
instead

The gauge exists on every proxy that has a database and the Prometheus callback, even when `spend_capture_rate_check`
is not configured: the job then sets it to `NaN` for every supported provider, so a dashboard or rule keyed on the
metric name finds the series before the check is turned on. With `prometheus_metrics_config` set, list
`litellm_spend_capture_rate` under a group or it is not emitted. Excluding `api_provider` through
`prometheus_exclude_labels` leaves the gauge with no labels, one series for the one supported provider

A Prometheus alerting rule that fires when the rate stays under 0.9 for an hour:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: litellm-spend-capture-rate
    rules:
      - alert: LiteLLMSpendCaptureRateLow
        expr: litellm_spend_capture_rate < 0.9
        for: 1h
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "LiteLLM is capturing under 90% of the OpenAI bill"
          description: "Spend is reaching OpenAI outside LiteLLM, or cost tracking is dropping it. See https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/spend_capture_rate"
```

## Check on demand

`GET /spend/capture_rate` runs the same comparison for any date range and returns the per-day breakdown. It needs a
proxy admin key (`PROXY_ADMIN` or `PROXY_ADMIN_VIEW_ONLY`, see [Role-based access](./access_control)) and reads the
OpenAI bill live, so `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` must be set on the proxy

```bash
curl "http://localhost:4000/spend/capture_rate?provider=openai&start_date=2026-09-17&end_date=2026-09-23&threshold=0.9&project_ids=proj_a&project_ids=proj_b" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234"
```

| Query parameter | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `start_date` | yes | | First UTC day, `YYYY-MM-DD`, inclusive |
| `end_date` | yes | | Last UTC day, `YYYY-MM-DD`, inclusive |
| `provider` | no | `openai` | Provider to compare. `openai` is the only value today |
| `threshold` | no | `0.9` | Ratio under which `below_threshold` is true. Over 0 and at most 1 |
| `project_ids` | no | | OpenAI project ids to scope the bill to. Repeat it for several. Captured spend is never scoped |

Response:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "start_date": "2026-09-17",
  "end_date": "2026-09-23",
  "captured_spend": 812.4,
  "provider_spend": 903.1,
  "capture_rate": 0.8996,
  "threshold": 0.9,
  "below_threshold": true,
  "days": [
    {"date": "2026-09-17", "captured_spend": 120.1, "provider_spend": 130.0, "capture_rate": 0.9238},
    {"date": "2026-09-18", "captured_spend": 0.0, "provider_spend": 0.0, "capture_rate": null}
  ]
}
```

`capture_rate` is `null` for a day with no bill, and for the whole range when OpenAI billed nothing across it, in which
case `below_threshold` is `false`. Values are returned as computed, without rounding

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | `end_date` is before `start_date`, or the range is over 180 days |
| `401` | The key is not a proxy admin |
| `422` | A query parameter fails validation, such as a malformed date or a `threshold` outside (0, 1] |
| `500` | The proxy has no database |
| `502` | The OpenAI costs API could not be read. The detail carries OpenAI's status and message |
| `503` | `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` is not set on the proxy |

## Reading the number

The comparison is per closed UTC day. The scheduled check never includes today, and an endpoint range that includes
today is partial on both sides, so read today's row as in progress rather than as a gap

The OpenAI bill is organization-wide unless `openai_project_ids` (or `project_ids` on the endpoint) scopes it, while
captured spend is always everything LiteLLM tracked for OpenAI. An organization with any traffic outside LiteLLM reads
under 1.0 for that reason alone. Scope the check to every project LiteLLM's keys belong to (leaving one out makes the
rate read high, since its captured spend still counts), or treat the gap as a measure of the direct traffic and raise
it with the teams sending it

Every deployment configured with `custom_llm_provider: openai` counts as captured spend, including one whose
`api_base` points at an OpenAI-compatible server such as a vLLM box or another gateway. That spend never shows up on
the OpenAI bill, so it inflates the rate. If you want the rate to mean OpenAI only, give those deployments a provider
of their own, such as `hosted_vllm`

LiteLLM prices from its own
[cost map](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json), so a price change on
either side moves the rate until the map catches up. A rate above 1.0 with no direct traffic usually means a cost map
entry is higher than what OpenAI now charges

OpenAI's costs API can lag a few hours behind usage, so the most recent day can read low until it settles. That is one
more reason the scheduled window stops at yesterday

Other providers (Anthropic, Azure, Bedrock, Vertex AI) are not wired yet. For those, follow

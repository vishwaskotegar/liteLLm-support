# Restrict Model Access

## **Restrict models by Virtual Key**

Set allowed models for a key using the `models` param

The `models` list both hides a model from `GET /v1/models` and blocks calls to it. To hide a model from the listing endpoints without blocking calls to it, set `model_info.discoverable: false` on the model instead ([Hide a model from `/v1/models`](./model_discovery#hide-a-model-from-v1models))


```shell
curl 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/generate' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your-master-key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"models": ["{{openai_small}}", "{{openai_large}}"]}'
```

:::info

This key can only make requests to `models` that are `{{openai_small}}` or `{{openai_large}}`

:::

Verify this is set correctly by 

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Allowed Access" value = "allowed">

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "{{openai_large}}",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
    ]
  }'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Disallowed Access" value = "not-allowed">

:::info

Expect this to fail since claude-sonnet-5 is not in the `models` for the key generated

:::

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "{{anthropic}}",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
    ]
  }'
```

## **Restrict models by `team_id`**
`litellm-dev` can only access `azure-gpt-3.5`

**1. Create a team via `/team/new`**
```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/team/new' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your-master-key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "team_alias": "litellm-dev",
  "models": ["azure-gpt-3.5"]
}' 

# returns {...,"team_id": "my-unique-id"}
```

**2. Create a key for team**
```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/key/generate' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"team_id": "my-unique-id"}'
```

**3. Test it**
```shell
curl --location 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/chat/completions' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer sk-qo992IjKOC2CHKZGRoJIGA' \
    --data '{
        "model": "BEDROCK_GROUP",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "hi"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

```shell
{"error":{"message":"Invalid model for team litellm-dev: BEDROCK_GROUP.  Valid models for team are: ['azure-gpt-3.5']\n\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/ishaanjaffer/Github/litellm/litellm/proxy/proxy_server.py\", line 2298, in chat_completion\n    _is_valid_team_configs(\n  File \"/Users/ishaanjaffer/Github/litellm/litellm/proxy/utils.py\", line 1296, in _is_valid_team_configs\n    raise Exception(\nException: Invalid model for team litellm-dev: BEDROCK_GROUP.

## **View Available Fallback Models**

Use the `/v1/models` endpoint to discover available fallback models for a given model. This helps you understand which backup models are available when your primary model is unavailable or restricted.

:::info[Extension Point]

The `include_metadata` parameter serves as an extension point for exposing additional model metadata in the future. While currently focused on fallback models, this approach will be expanded to include other model metadata such as pricing information, capabilities, rate limits, and more.

:::

### Basic Usage

Get all available models:

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4000/v1/models' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>'
```

### Get Fallback Models with Metadata

Include metadata to see fallback model information:

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4000/v1/models?include_metadata=true' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>'
```

### Get Specific Fallback Types

You can specify the type of fallbacks you want to see:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="general" label="General Fallbacks">

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4000/v1/models?include_metadata=true&fallback_type=general' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>'
```

General fallbacks are alternative models that can handle the same types of requests.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="context_window" label="Context Window Fallbacks">

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4000/v1/models?include_metadata=true&fallback_type=context_window' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>'
```

Context window fallbacks are models with larger context windows that can handle requests when the primary model's context limit is exceeded.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="content_policy" label="Content Policy Fallbacks">

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4000/v1/models?include_metadata=true&fallback_type=content_policy' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>'
```

Content policy fallbacks are models that can handle requests when the primary model rejects content due to safety policies.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Example Response

When `include_metadata=true` is specified, each model carries a `metadata.fallbacks` list for a single fallback type, the one named by `fallback_type` (`general` when omitted). To see all three types, send one request per `fallback_type`:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "{{openai_large}}",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1677610602,
      "owned_by": "openai",
      "metadata": {
        "fallbacks": ["{{openai_small}}", "{{anthropic}}"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Use Cases

- **High Availability**: Identify backup models to ensure service continuity
- **Cost Optimization**: Find cheaper alternatives when primary models are expensive
- **Content Filtering**: Discover models with different content policies
- **Context Length**: Find models that can handle larger inputs
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple compatible models

### API Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `include_metadata` | boolean | Include additional model metadata including fallbacks |
| `fallback_type` | string | Which fallbacks to return in `metadata.fallbacks`: `general` (default), `context_window`, or `content_policy`. Any other value returns a 400 |

## **Reserve a deployment for a team during a time window**

Set `model_info.access_windows` on a deployment to reserve it for specific teams during a daily local-time window. While a window is active the router only hands that deployment to requests whose key belongs to one of the listed teams; requests from other teams, and requests from keys with no team (including the master key), are routed to other deployments in the same model group or rejected with a `400` if every candidate is reserved. Outside the window routing is unchanged. The deployment stays listed in `/v1/models` and `/model/info` at all times.

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: gpt-4o-ptu
    litellm_params:
      model: azure/gpt-4o-ptu
      api_base: os.environ/AZURE_PTU_BASE
      api_key: os.environ/AZURE_PTU_KEY
    model_info:
      access_windows:
        - start: "22:00"
          end: "06:00"
          timezone: "America/New_York"
          team_ids: ["team-nightly-batch"]
```

`start` and `end` are `HH:MM` wall-clock times in the given IANA `timezone` (daylight saving is applied automatically). `start` is inclusive and `end` is exclusive; a `start` later than `end` means the window crosses midnight. A deployment can list several windows; it is reserved whenever any of them is active. The proxy refuses to start when a window has an invalid time, an unknown timezone, an empty `team_ids`, or equal `start` and `end`.

A rejected request looks like this:

```json
{"error":{"message":"litellm.BadRequestError: Deployment gpt-4o-ptu is reserved for another team until 06:00 America/New_York","type":"invalid_request_error","param":null,"code":"400"}}
```

## Advanced: Model Access Groups

For advanced use cases, use [Model Access Groups](./model_access_groups) to dynamically group multiple models and manage access without restarting the proxy.

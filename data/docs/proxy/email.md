## Usage

### 1. Configure email integration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="smtp" label="SMTP">

Get SMTP credentials to set this up

```yaml showLineNumbers title="proxy_config.yaml"
litellm_settings:
    callbacks: ["smtp_email"]
```

Add the following to your proxy env

```shell showLineNumbers
SMTP_HOST="smtp.resend.com"
SMTP_TLS="True"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USERNAME="resend"
SMTP_SENDER_EMAIL="notifications@alerts.litellm.ai"
SMTP_PASSWORD="xxxxx"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="resend" label="Resend API">

Add `resend_email` to your proxy config.yaml under `litellm_settings`

set the following env variables

```shell showLineNumbers
RESEND_API_KEY="re_1234"
```

```yaml showLineNumbers title="proxy_config.yaml"
litellm_settings:
    callbacks: ["resend_email"]
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sendgrid" label="SendGrid API">

Add `sendgrid_email` to your proxy config.yaml under `litellm_settings`

set the following env variables

```shell showLineNumbers
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.1234"
SENDGRID_SENDER_EMAIL="notifications@your-domain.com"
```

```yaml showLineNumbers title="proxy_config.yaml"
litellm_settings:
  callbacks: ["sendgrid_email"]
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Create a new user

On the LiteLLM Proxy UI, go to users > create a new user. 

After creating a new user, they will receive an email invite a the email you specified when creating the user. 

### 3. Configure Budget Alerts (Optional)

Enable budget alert emails by adding "email" to the `alerting` list in your proxy configuration:

```yaml showLineNumbers title="proxy_config.yaml"
general_settings:
  alerting: ["email"]
```

#### Budget Alert Types

**Soft Budget Alerts**: Automatically triggered when a key exceeds its soft budget limit. These alerts help you monitor spending before reaching critical thresholds.

**Max Budget Alerts**: Automatically triggered when a key reaches a specified percentage of its maximum budget (default: 80%). These alerts warn you when you're approaching budget exhaustion.

Both alert types send a maximum of one email per 24-hour period to prevent spam.

#### Per-key thresholds and recipients

By default a max budget alert fires at one threshold and goes only to the email of the user who owns the key, so a key with no owner email sends nothing. To choose your own thresholds and notify additional people, set `max_budget_alert_emails` in the key's metadata. Each entry maps a percentage of that key's `max_budget` to the recipients notified once spend crosses it.

```shell showLineNumbers
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/generate' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "max_budget": 100,
    "metadata": {
      "max_budget_alert_emails": {
        "50": ["owner@your-company.com"],
        "75": ["owner@your-company.com", "finance@your-company.com"],
        "100": ["oncall@your-company.com"]
      }
    }
  }'
```

With the key above, spend of $50 emails the owner, $75 emails the owner and finance, and $100 emails on-call. Recipients can be a list or a comma separated string, and the key owner's email is always included alongside whoever you configure. Each threshold sends at most one email per key per `EMAIL_BUDGET_ALERT_TTL`. A 100% threshold still fires on the request that exhausts the budget, because the alert check runs before the request is rejected.

Configuring `max_budget_alert_emails` on a key replaces the default 80% alert for that key. To change thresholds on an existing key, send the same `metadata` block to `/key/update`.

There is no UI field for this yet, so set it through `/key/generate` or `/key/update`.

#### Team member budget thresholds and recipients

Teams that set `team_member_budget` cap what each member can spend inside that team, and by default nothing is emailed before or when a member hits the cap. To alert on a member's budget, set `team_member_max_budget_alert_emails` in the team's metadata. Each entry maps a percentage of `team_member_budget` to the extra recipients notified once that member's spend in the team crosses it.

```shell showLineNumbers
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/team/update' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "team_id": "my-team",
    "team_member_budget": 100,
    "metadata": {
      "team_member_max_budget_alert_emails": {
        "50": [],
        "100": ["finance@your-company.com"]
      }
    }
  }'
```

With the team above, a member who has spent $50 of their $100 budget gets an email, and at $100 both the member and finance get one. The member's own email (from their user record) is always included, so an empty list means only the member is notified, and a member with no email on file gets nothing while the configured recipients still do. Alerts fire once per member, per team, per threshold within `EMAIL_BUDGET_ALERT_TTL`, and the 100% alert is sent on the request that exhausts the budget, before that request is rejected. Once spend reaches the lowest configured threshold, Slack and webhook destinations also get a `Team Member Budget` event for that member at the fixed points other budget types use (15% and 5% remaining, and budget crossed), with `event_group` set to `team_member`.

The same block is available in the Admin UI under the team's Team Member Settings, and `/team/new` accepts it in `metadata` as well. Invalid entries, such as a threshold that is not a whole number from 1 to 100, are ignored.

#### Default thresholds for every key

Set `default_key_max_budget_alert_emails` to apply a baseline to all keys. Per-key entries merge into the global config one threshold at a time, so a key inherits the global recipients for a threshold and adds its own on top rather than overwriting them.

```yaml showLineNumbers title="proxy_config.yaml"
general_settings:
  alerting: ["email"]

litellm_settings:
  default_key_max_budget_alert_emails:
    "80": ["platform-team@your-company.com"]
```

#### Configuration Options

Customize budget alert behavior using these environment variables:

```bash showLineNumbers title=".env"
# Percentage of max budget that triggers alerts (as decimal: 0.8 = 80%)
# Only applies to keys without max_budget_alert_emails configured
EMAIL_BUDGET_ALERT_MAX_SPEND_ALERT_PERCENTAGE=0.8

# Time-to-live for alert deduplication in seconds (default: 24 hours)
EMAIL_BUDGET_ALERT_TTL=86400
```

## HTML Support in Email Signature

The `EMAIL_SIGNATURE` field supports HTML formatting for rich, branded email footers. Here's an example of what you can include:

```html
<p>Best regards,<br/>The LiteLLM Team</p>
<p>
  <a href='https://docs.litellm.ai'>Documentation</a> |
  <a href='https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm'>GitHub</a>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 12px; color: #666;'>
  This is an automated message from LiteLLM Proxy
</p>
```

Supported HTML features:
- Text formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
- Line breaks (`<br/>`)
- Links (`<a href='...'>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Basic inline styling
- Company information and social media links
- Legal disclaimers or terms of service links

## Environment Variables

You can customize the following aspects of emails through environment variables:

```bash
# Email Branding
EMAIL_LOGO_URL="https://your-company.com/logo.png"  # Custom logo URL
EMAIL_SUPPORT_CONTACT="support@your-company.com"     # Support contact email
EMAIL_SIGNATURE="<p>Best regards,<br/>Your Company Team</p><p><a href='https://your-company.com'>Visit our website</a></p>"  # Custom HTML footer/signature

# Email Subject Lines
EMAIL_SUBJECT_INVITATION="Welcome to Your Company!"  # Subject for invitation emails
EMAIL_SUBJECT_KEY_CREATED="Your API Key is Ready"    # Subject for key creation emails
EMAIL_SUBJECT_KEY_ROTATED="Your API Key Has Been Rotated"  # Subject for key rotation emails

# Security Settings
EMAIL_INCLUDE_API_KEY="false"  # Set to false to hide API keys in emails (default: true)

# Proxy Configuration
PROXY_BASE_URL="https://proxy.your-company.com"      # Base URL for the LiteLLM Proxy (used in email links)
```

## Security: Hiding API Keys in Emails

For enhanced security, you can configure LiteLLM to **not** include actual API keys in email notifications. This is useful when:

- You want to reduce the risk of key exposure via email interception
- Your security policy requires keys to only be retrieved from the secure dashboard
- You're concerned about email forwarding or storage security

When disabled, emails will show: `[Key hidden for security - retrieve from dashboard]` instead of the actual API key.

**Configuration:**

```bash
# Hide API keys in emails (enhanced security)
EMAIL_INCLUDE_API_KEY="false"

# Include API keys in emails (default behavior)
EMAIL_INCLUDE_API_KEY="true"  # or omit this variable
```

**Behavior:**

| Setting | Key Created Email | Key Rotated Email |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| `true` (default) | Shows actual `sk-xxxxx` key | Shows actual `sk-xxxxx` key |
| `false` | Shows placeholder message | Shows placeholder message |

Users can always retrieve their keys from the LiteLLM Proxy dashboard.

## HTML Support in Email Signature

The `EMAIL_SIGNATURE` environment variable supports HTML formatting, allowing you to create rich, branded email footers. You can include:

- Text formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
- Line breaks using `<br/>`
- Links using `<a href='...'>`
- Paragraphs using `<p>`
- Company information and social media links
- Legal disclaimers or terms of service links

Example HTML signature:
```html
<p>Best regards,<br/>The LiteLLM Team</p>
<p>
  <a href='https://docs.litellm.ai'>Documentation</a> |
  <a href='https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm'>GitHub</a>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 12px; color: #666;'>
  This is an automated message from LiteLLM Proxy
</p>
```

## Default Templates

If environment variables are not set, LiteLLM will use default templates:

- Default logo: LiteLLM logo
- Default support contact: support@berri.ai
- Default signature: Standard LiteLLM footer
- Default subjects: "LiteLLM: \{event_message\}" (replaced with actual event message)

## Template Variables

When setting custom email subjects, the only supported template variable is `\{event_message\}`, which is replaced with the event message (for example "Welcome to LiteLLM Proxy" or "API Key Created"). Any other placeholder, such as `\{company_name\}`, causes a `KeyError` when the email is built and the email is not sent. Use plain text for anything else:

```bash
# Examples of template variable usage
EMAIL_SUBJECT_INVITATION="Welcome to Acme! \{event_message\}"
EMAIL_SUBJECT_KEY_CREATED="Your Acme API Key"
```

## FAQ 

### Why do I see "http://0.0.0.0:4000" in the email links?

The `PROXY_BASE_URL` environment variable is used to construct email links. If you are using the LiteLLM Proxy in a local environment, you will see "http://0.0.0.0:4000" in the email links.

If you are using the LiteLLM Proxy in a production environment, you will see the actual base URL of the LiteLLM Proxy.

You can set the `PROXY_BASE_URL` environment variable to the actual base URL of the LiteLLM Proxy.

```bash
PROXY_BASE_URL="https://proxy.your-company.com"
```

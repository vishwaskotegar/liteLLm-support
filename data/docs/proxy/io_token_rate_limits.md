# [Beta] Separate ITPM / OTPM Rate Limits

Enforce **input tokens per minute (ITPM)** and **output tokens per minute (OTPM)** separately on router deployments.

Use this when a provider publishes separate input/output throughput limits (for example Bedrock Mantle model cards), instead of a single combined TPM.

:::info
This uses the same `enforce_model_rate_limits` pre-call check as [combined TPM/RPM enforcement](./load_balancing#enforce-model-rate-limits). Set `itpm` / `otpm` on a deployment instead of `tpm` / `rpm`.
:::

## Quick Start

```yaml showLineNumbers title="config.yaml"
model_list:
  - model_name: gpt-oss-120b
    litellm_params:
      model: bedrock_mantle/openai.gpt-oss-120b
      aws_region_name: us-east-1
      itpm: 500000   # 500K input tokens per minute
      otpm: 100000   # 100K output tokens per minute

router_settings:
  optional_pre_call_checks:
    - enforce_model_rate_limits
```

Start the proxy:

```bash
litellm --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

Set `itpm` / `otpm` to the values from your provider quota or model card (Service Quotas console for Bedrock Mantle, or your internal capacity plan).

## Mantle-style reservation

LiteLLM follows the same reservation model as the [Bedrock Mantle endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas-mantle.html): token limits are enforced **before** the upstream call, then reconciled after the response.

### Pre-call (admission)

Before the request is sent to the provider:

1. **Estimate input tokens** from the request body (`messages`, `prompt`, or Responses `input`).
2. **Resolve an effective output cap** — the stand-in for `max_tokens` when checking quotas:

| Priority | Source | Example (`openai.gpt-oss-120b`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Request `max_tokens` or `max_completion_tokens` | Client sends `max_tokens: 1024` → use `1024` |
| 2 | Model map `max_output_tokens` (fallback `max_tokens`) | No client cap → use `32768` from the model card |
| 3 | Hard default | Unknown model → `4096` |

3. **ITPM check:** reserve `estimated_input + effective_output_cap` against the deployment ITPM limit. Block with `429` if admission would exceed the limit.
4. **OTPM check:** ensure `current_otpm + effective_output_cap` fits the OTPM limit. If OTPM would be exceeded, roll back the ITPM reservation and return `429`.

This mirrors Mantle: when the client omits `max_tokens`, LiteLLM assumes the model's **maximum output capacity**, not its input context window. That is why a missing `max_tokens` on a large model can reserve a lot of ITPM/OTPM headroom.

:::tip
Set `max_tokens` (or `max_output_tokens` on Responses) close to your expected completion size. Mantle and LiteLLM both reconcile down after the response, but a high default cap still blocks concurrent requests until the call finishes.
:::

### Post-call (reconciliation)

After a successful response:

| Counter | What gets recorded |
| --- | --- |
| **ITPM** | Replace the pre-call reservation with `billable_input + completion_tokens`, where `billable_input = prompt_tokens - cached_tokens` |
| **OTPM** | Add actual `completion_tokens` |

If the request **fails** before completion, the ITPM reservation is refunded; OTPM is not charged.

### Worked example

Request with no `max_tokens` against `bedrock_mantle/openai.gpt-oss-120b` (`max_output_tokens: 32768`), `itpm: 500000`:

| Step | Calculation | ITPM usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-call reserve | `12` input est. + `32768` output cap | `32780` reserved |
| Response | `prompt_tokens=10`, `completion_tokens=150`, no cache | — |
| Post-call reconcile | `10 + 150` | `160` final |

Without an explicit `max_tokens`, the pre-call hold is much larger than the final charge, the same behavior Mantle documents for quota reservation.

## How It Works

| Phase | ITPM | OTPM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pre-call** | Reserves `estimated_input + effective_output_cap` | Checks `current_otpm + effective_output_cap` |
| **Post-call** | Reconciles to `billable_input + completion_tokens` | Adds actual `completion_tokens` |
| **Failure** | Refunds the ITPM reservation | No OTPM charge |

**Cached prompt tokens** (`prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`) are excluded from ITPM billing after the response.

## Response Headers

When a model group has `itpm` or `otpm` configured, LiteLLM returns:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-input-tokens` | ITPM limit for the model group |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-input-tokens` | Remaining ITPM capacity this minute |
| `x-ratelimit-reset-input-tokens` | Seconds until the minute window resets |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-output-tokens` | OTPM limit for the model group |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-output-tokens` | Remaining OTPM capacity this minute |
| `x-ratelimit-reset-output-tokens` | Seconds until the minute window resets |

## Error Response

When a limit is exceeded before the upstream call:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Model rate limit exceeded. ITPM limit=500000, current usage=500120",
    "type": "rate_limit_error",
    "code": 429
  }
}
```

The response includes a `retry-after` header (seconds until the current minute window resets).

## Project-Level Limits

Enforce per-model ITPM / OTPM quotas for a [project](./project_management) on the proxy. Set `model_itpm_limit` and `model_otpm_limit` when creating or updating a project: each maps a model name (the `model_name` clients request) to a token-per-minute limit.

```bash showLineNumbers
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/project/new' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_MASTER_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "project_alias": "my-project",
    "team_id": "<team-id>",
    "models": ["claude-fable-5"],
    "model_itpm_limit": {"claude-fable-5": 300000},
    "model_otpm_limit": {"claude-fable-5": 100000}
  }'
```

Requests made with the project's keys count against these limits. Enforcement follows the same reservation model as deployment limits: LiteLLM reserves the input estimate plus the effective output cap before the upstream call, then reconciles to actual usage after the response. No router settings are needed. The proxy's rate limiter enforces the project metadata automatically. This requires a database, since projects live in the proxy DB.

### Project response headers

Successful responses on models with a project limit include:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `x-ratelimit-model_per_project_itpm-limit-tokens` | Project ITPM limit for the model |
| `x-ratelimit-model_per_project_itpm-remaining-tokens` | Remaining project ITPM this minute |
| `x-ratelimit-model_per_project_otpm-limit-tokens` | Project OTPM limit for the model |
| `x-ratelimit-model_per_project_otpm-remaining-tokens` | Remaining project OTPM this minute |

### Project error response

A request that would exceed a project limit is blocked with `429` before the upstream call:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded for model_per_project_itpm: <project-id>:claude-fable-5. Limit type: tokens. Current limit: 300000, Remaining: 300000. Limit resets at: 2026-08-18 14:48:49 UTC",
    "type": "throttling_error",
    "code": "429"
  }
}
```

## ITPM vs TPM

| Setting | What it limits | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tpm` | Total tokens per minute (single counter) | Legacy combined throughput limits |
| `itpm` + `otpm` | Input and output separately | Provider docs with distinct input/output TPM (Bedrock Mantle) |

Do **not** set both modes on the same deployment. If `itpm` or `otpm` is present, LiteLLM uses the ITPM/OTPM path and ignores combined TPM tracking for that deployment.

## Multi-Instance Deployment

Share counters across proxy replicas with Redis:

```yaml showLineNumbers title="config.yaml"
router_settings:
  optional_pre_call_checks:
    - enforce_model_rate_limits
  redis_host: redis.example.com
  redis_port: 6379
  redis_password: your-password
```

## SDK Usage

```python showLineNumbers title="example.py"
from litellm import Router

router = Router(
    model_list=[
        {
            "model_name": "gpt-oss-120b",
            "litellm_params": {
                "model": "bedrock_mantle/openai.gpt-oss-120b",
                "itpm": 500_000,
                "otpm": 100_000,
            },
        }
    ],
    optional_pre_call_checks=["enforce_model_rate_limits"],
)

response = await router.acompletion(
    model="gpt-oss-120b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    max_tokens=1024,  # explicit cap avoids over-reserving model max_output_tokens
)
```

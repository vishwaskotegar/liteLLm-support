As a Proxy Admin, you can check if and when a entity (key, team, user, model) was created, updated, deleted, or regenerated, along with who performed the action. This is useful for auditing and compliance.

LiteLLM tracks changes to the following entities and actions:

- **Entities:** Keys, Teams, Users, Models
- **Actions:** Create, Update, Delete, Regenerate

<EnterpriseFeature />

## Usage

### 1. Switch on audit Logs 
With an enterprise license, audit logs are on by default, so there is nothing to configure. On other plans, or if you want to be explicit, add `store_audit_logs` to your litellm config.yaml and then start the proxy
```shell
litellm_settings:
  store_audit_logs: true
```

To turn audit logs off on an enterprise license, set it explicitly to `false`, which takes precedence over the default. `LITELLM_STORE_AUDIT_LOGS` works the same way as the config setting and is read when the config leaves `store_audit_logs` unset

```shell
litellm_settings:
  store_audit_logs: false
```

### 2. Make a change to an entity

In this example, we will delete a key.

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/delete' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "key": "d5265fc73296c8fea819b4525590c99beab8c707e465afdf60dab57e1fa145e4"
    }'
```

### 3. View the audit log on LiteLLM UI

On the LiteLLM UI, navigate to Logs -> Audit Logs. You should see the audit log for the key deletion.

## Export Audit Logs to External Storage

You can export audit logs to an external storage backend (e.g. S3) in addition to storing them in the database. Logs are batched and uploaded asynchronously, so they do not block your proxy requests.

### S3 Example

Add `audit_log_callbacks` and `s3_callback_params` to your `litellm_settings`:

```yaml
litellm_settings:
  store_audit_logs: true
  audit_log_callbacks: ["s3_v2"]
  s3_callback_params:
    s3_bucket_name: my-audit-logs-bucket     # AWS Bucket Name
    s3_region_name: us-west-2                # AWS Region
    s3_aws_access_key_id: os.environ/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    s3_aws_secret_access_key: os.environ/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    s3_path: litellm-audit                   # [OPTIONAL] prefix path in the bucket
```

Audit logs are written as JSON files to:

```
s3://<bucket>/audit_logs/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<HH-MM-SS>_<audit-log-id>.json
# or, when s3_path is set:
s3://<bucket>/<s3_path>/audit_logs/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<HH-MM-SS>_<audit-log-id>.json
```

:::info

`audit_log_callbacks` only fires while audit logging is enabled, which is the default on an enterprise license and otherwise needs `store_audit_logs: true`.

:::

### Send Audit Logs to a Separate S3 Bucket

If you also send normal request/response logs to S3 via `callbacks: ["s3_v2"]`, by default both streams share `s3_callback_params` and land in the same bucket. To send audit logs to a different bucket (e.g. a compliance-only bucket with stricter access controls or longer retention), add an `s3_audit_callback_params` block. It accepts the same fields as `s3_callback_params` and only applies to audit logs.

```yaml
litellm_settings:
  store_audit_logs: true
  callbacks: ["s3_v2"]                       # normal request logs
  audit_log_callbacks: ["s3_v2"]             # audit logs

  s3_callback_params:                        # used for normal logs
    s3_bucket_name: my-llm-logs-bucket
    s3_region_name: us-west-2
    s3_aws_access_key_id: os.environ/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    s3_aws_secret_access_key: os.environ/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    s3_path: litellm-logs

  s3_audit_callback_params:                  # used for audit logs only
    s3_bucket_name: my-audit-logs-bucket
    s3_region_name: us-east-1                # different region OK
    s3_aws_access_key_id: os.environ/AWS_AUDIT_ACCESS_KEY_ID  # different creds OK
    s3_aws_secret_access_key: os.environ/AWS_AUDIT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    s3_path: litellm-audit
```

## Advanced

### Attribute Management changes to Users

Call management endpoints on behalf of a user, and have the audit log attribute the change to them instead of to the calling key's `user_id`. (Useful when connecting proxy to your development platform).

:::warning[Opt in required since v1.84.0]

Before v1.84.0 the `LiteLLM-Changed-By` header was honored unconditionally, which let any caller rewrite audit attribution. Since v1.84.0 the proxy ignores the header unless the calling key, or its team, has `allow_litellm_changed_by_header: true` in its metadata; without the opt in, `changed_by` falls back to the calling key's `user_id`. The master key cannot opt in because it has no stored metadata, so send the header with an admin virtual key

:::

#### 1. Allow your admin key to set the header

Set `allow_litellm_changed_by_header: true` in the metadata of the admin virtual key that will send the header. Setting it on the key's team metadata instead opts in every key on that team

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/update' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "key": "sk-my-admin-key",
        "metadata": {"allow_litellm_changed_by_header": true}
    }'
```

#### 2. Set `LiteLLM-Changed-By` in request headers

Set the 'user_id' in request headers, when calling a management endpoint. [View Full List](https://docs.litellm.ai/api-reference/#/team%20management).

- Update Team budget with the opted-in admin key. 
- Attribute change to 'krrish@berri.ai'. 

**Key change:** Passing `-H 'LiteLLM-Changed-By: krrish@berri.ai'`

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/team/update' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-my-admin-key' \
    -H 'LiteLLM-Changed-By: krrish@berri.ai' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "team_id" : "8bf18b11-7f52-4717-8e1f-7c65f9d01e52",
        "max_budget": 2000
    }'
```

#### 3. Emitted Audit Log 

```bash
{
   "id": "bd136c28-edd0-4cb6-b963-f35464cf6f5a",
   "updated_at": "2024-06-08 23:41:14.793",

## API SPEC of Audit Log 


### `id`
- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** This is the unique identifier for each audit log entry. It is automatically generated as a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) by default.

### `updated_at`
- **Type:** `DateTime`
- **Description:** This field stores the timestamp of when the audit log entry was created or updated. It is automatically set to the current date and time by default.

### `changed_by`
- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** The `user_id` that performed the audited action. If the `LiteLLM-Changed-By` header is passed and the calling key or its team has `allow_litellm_changed_by_header: true` in its metadata, then `changed_by=<value passed for LiteLLM-Changed-By header>`

### `changed_by_api_key`
- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** This field stores the hashed API key that was used to perform the audited action. If left blank, it defaults to an empty string.

### `action`
- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** The type of action that was performed. One of "create", "update", or "delete".

### `table_name`
- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** This field stores the name of the table that was affected by the audited action. It can be one of the following values: `LiteLLM_TeamTable`, `LiteLLM_UserTable`, `LiteLLM_VerificationToken`


### `object_id`
- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** This field stores the ID of the object that was affected by the audited action. It can be the key ID, team ID, user ID

### `before_value`
- **Type:** `Json?`
- **Description:** This field stores the value of the row before the audited action was performed. It is optional and can be null.

### `updated_values`
- **Type:** `Json?`
- **Description:** This field stores the values of the row that were updated after the audited action was performed

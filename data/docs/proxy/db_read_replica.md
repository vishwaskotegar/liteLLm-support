# Database Read Replica

LiteLLM Proxy can route read-only queries to a separate database endpoint while
writes continue to go to the primary. This is useful for Aurora-style clusters
that expose distinct reader/writer endpoints, where directing reads at the
reader keeps the writer free for transactional workloads.

## Quick start

Set `DATABASE_URL_READ_REPLICA` alongside the existing `DATABASE_URL`:

```shell
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@writer.db.example.com:5432/litellm
export DATABASE_URL_READ_REPLICA=postgresql://user:pass@reader.db.example.com:5432/litellm
```

The proxy automatically detects the env var on startup and switches the
internal Prisma client into a routing mode that splits traffic between the two
endpoints. If `DATABASE_URL_READ_REPLICA` is unset, the proxy continues to use
single-database behavior; no other configuration is required.

## What gets routed

| Operation | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| `find_first`, `find_many`, `find_unique` (and `_or_raise` variants) | Reader |
| `count`, `group_by` | Reader |
| `query_raw`, `query_first` | Reader |
| `create`, `update`, `upsert`, `delete`, `update_many`, `delete_many` | Writer |
| `execute_raw` | Writer |
| Transactions (`tx`, `batch_`) | Writer |

Reads originating in code (e.g. virtual key lookup, team membership, spend
queries) are dispatched to the reader without changes to call sites. The
routing wrapper intercepts the per-model action accessor and chooses the
backend per method.

## Reader degradation

If the reader endpoint is unreachable at startup, the proxy logs a warning and
falls back to the writer for reads instead of failing to start:

```
Failed to connect to read replica DB: <error>. Falling back to the writer for
reads until the reader is reachable.
```

The same fallback applies if the reader fails during a reconnect cycle. The
next successful reader recreate clears the degraded flag and reads start
hitting the reader again.

This means: enabling read-replica routing **never reduces availability**. At
worst it degrades to single-database performance.

## Token-based database authentication

When `IAM_TOKEN_DB_AUTH=True` (AWS RDS IAM) or `AZURE_POSTGRESQL_AUTH=True`
(Microsoft Entra ID), both the writer and the reader refresh their tokens
independently, each ahead of its own expiry. You can supply the reader either
as a single `DATABASE_URL_READ_REPLICA` or assembled from the component vars
(`DATABASE_HOST_READ_REPLICA`, `DATABASE_USER_READ_REPLICA`, and friends); the
token-refresh path re-parses the resulting reader URL, so only the token
rotates after startup.

On AWS this pairs naturally with Aurora's reader endpoint, which resolves to
the reader instances in the cluster. On Azure it pairs with the read replicas
of an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server.

## Kubernetes / Helm

The official Helm chart exposes two ways to wire the reader URL:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="secret" label="From a Kubernetes secret (recommended)">

When the reader URL embeds credentials, source it from the existing
`db.secret.name` Kubernetes secret using `db.secret.readReplicaUrlKey`. This
keeps the URL out of the rendered pod spec and the Helm release secret.

```yaml
db:
  useExisting: true
  secret:
    name: postgres
    usernameKey: username
    passwordKey: password
    # Add the reader URL to the same secret under any key, then reference it:
    readReplicaUrlKey: read-url
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="plain" label="Plaintext value">

For credential-less URLs (for example, when `IAM_TOKEN_DB_AUTH` or
`AZURE_POSTGRESQL_AUTH` supplies the password at runtime),
`db.readReplicaUrl` works:

```yaml
db:
  readReplicaUrl: "postgresql://litellm@reader.aurora.local:5432/litellm"
```

Avoid this form if the URL embeds a password, since the value renders into the
pod spec and the Helm release secret.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Docker Compose

Add the env var to your service:

```yaml
services:
  litellm:
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://user:pass@writer:5432/litellm
      DATABASE_URL_READ_REPLICA: postgresql://user:pass@reader:5432/litellm
```

## When to enable it

Read-replica routing is most useful when:

- You're on Aurora (or another managed Postgres with reader endpoints) and
  want to offload spend / team / key lookups from the writer.
- Read traffic dominates and writer CPU / connections are constrained.
- You want geographic read locality (reader closer to the proxy).

It is **not** useful when:

- Your primary and replica are the same physical endpoint.
- You're running a single-node Postgres without replicas.
- Replication lag would invalidate consistency assumptions in your app. Note
  that all reads route to the reader, including reads that immediately follow
  a write.

## Replication lag

The proxy does not implement read-after-write consistency for the reader
endpoint. If your replication lag is meaningful (>100ms) and you have flows
that write then immediately read the same row, those reads may see stale data.
`query_raw` and `query_first` on the proxy's Prisma client route to the reader
like every other read, so code that needs read-your-writes consistency should
read through `WriterPinnedClient` (from `litellm.proxy.db.routing_prisma_wrapper`)
or inside a transaction (`tx`), both of which run on the writer

## Related env vars

| Env var | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Writer connection URL (required). |
| `DATABASE_URL_READ_REPLICA` | Reader connection URL (optional). When unset, all reads go to the writer. |
| `IAM_TOKEN_DB_AUTH` | When `True`, both writer and reader refresh AWS RDS IAM tokens automatically. |
| `AZURE_POSTGRESQL_AUTH` | When `True`, both writer and reader refresh Microsoft Entra ID tokens automatically. |

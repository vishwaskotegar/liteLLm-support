# Connect Codex CLI to LiteLLM

[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) reads all of its configuration from `~/.codex/config.toml`. You define LiteLLM as a custom model provider there and register the [MCP gateway](../../mcp.md) in the same file. This is the same config the [Codex surface inside ChatGPT Desktop](./codex_chatgpt_desktop.md) uses, so setting it up once covers both.

## Quick reference

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Config file | `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| `base_url` | `<LITELLM_PROXY_BASE_URL>/v1` (e.g. `http://localhost:4000/v1`) |
| Provider key | Your LiteLLM [virtual key](../virtual_keys.md), read from the env var named in `env_key` |
| MCP endpoint | `<LITELLM_PROXY_BASE_URL>/<server_name>/mcp` |
| MCP auth | The same virtual key, read from the env var named in `bearer_token_env_var` |

## LLM setup

### 1. Install Codex

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
```

Or with the official installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Define LiteLLM as a model provider

Codex uses the OpenAI Responses API, which LiteLLM serves at `/v1/responses`. Add a provider block to `~/.codex/config.toml` and select it as the default. `env_key` names the environment variable Codex reads your virtual key from, so no secret is stored in the file:

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
model = "{{anthropic}}"
model_provider = "litellm"

[model_providers.litellm]
name = "LiteLLM"
base_url = "http://localhost:4000/v1"
env_key = "LITELLM_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
```

Long agent turns can idle for minutes behind a gateway, so raise the stream timeout and retries if tasks are cut short:

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
[model_providers.litellm]
stream_idle_timeout_ms = 7200000
stream_max_retries = 5
request_max_retries = 4
```

Export the key, then run Codex:

```bash
export LITELLM_API_KEY="sk-1234"

codex
```

`model` can be any `model_name` from your LiteLLM config. Override it per run with `codex --model {{gemini_pro}}`. Codex only knows the metadata of OpenAI's own models, so with a gateway name it prints `Model metadata for ... not found. Defaulting to fallback metadata` on the first request; requests still go through.

Codex shows the model in its startup header and routes the task through the gateway. Here Codex 0.154 is answering through a local gateway:

### 3. Verify

Ask Codex to make a small change, then check the Admin UI under **Logs** or **Usage**; the request appears under `/v1/responses`, attributed to your virtual key and the model you selected.

The row carries no end user yet, since Codex has no setting that puts one in the request body. To attribute each request to a developer, customer, or project instead, add a LiteLLM tracking header to the provider block with `http_headers` or `env_http_headers`; see [Codex CLI granular cost tracking](../../tutorials/codex_customer_tracking.md).

## MCP setup

Register the LiteLLM MCP gateway as a streamable HTTP server in the same `~/.codex/config.toml`. Codex reads the bearer token from an environment variable rather than from the file, so reuse the one you already exported for the model provider:

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
[mcp_servers.litellm]
url = "http://localhost:4000/my_mcp_server/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "LITELLM_API_KEY"
```

`my_mcp_server` must match a key under `mcp_servers:` in your gateway config, and the key needs access to that server (see [the overview](./overview.md#the-values-you-will-reuse-everywhere)). Codex sends the key as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, which the gateway accepts. Start `codex` and run `/mcp`: the server shows as `connected` with its tool count, and `/mcp verbose` lists the tools prefixed with the server name (`my_mcp_server-read_wiki_structure`) and `Auth: Bearer token`.

<Image img={require('../../../img/client_setup/codex_cli_mcp.png')} />

A literal `bearer_token = "..."` in the server block fails on current Codex with `bearer_token is not supported for streamable_http`; use `bearer_token_env_var`. If the server does not show up at all, you are on an older Codex build that ignores remote MCP servers unless `experimental_use_rmcp_client = true` is set under `[features]`; upgrade Codex instead.

For a LiteLLM server that fronts an upstream OAuth provider, run `codex mcp login litellm` to complete the flow instead of setting a static token; see [MCP OAuth](../../mcp_oauth.md).

## Troubleshooting

Connection refused means the gateway is not reachable at the `base_url` you set; check the host, port, and the `/v1` suffix. A 401 from the gateway means `LITELLM_API_KEY` is not exported in the shell you launch `codex` from, or the key is no longer valid. `Invalid model name passed in` means `model` does not match a `model_name` in your gateway config; use your name, not the upstream provider's. If requests never appear in the Admin UI you are still on the default provider, so confirm `model_provider = "litellm"` is set at the top level of the file.

## Next steps

[Codex in ChatGPT Desktop](./codex_chatgpt_desktop.md) uses this same config file. See also [LiteLLM virtual keys](../virtual_keys.md) and the [MCP gateway reference](../../mcp.md).

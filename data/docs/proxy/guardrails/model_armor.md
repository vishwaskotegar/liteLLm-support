# Google Cloud Model Armor

LiteLLM supports Google Cloud Model Armor guardrails via the [Model Armor API](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/model-armor-overview). 


## Supported Guardrails

- [Model Armor Templates](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/manage-model-armor-templates) - Content sanitization and blocking based on configured templates

## Quick Start
### 1. Define Guardrails on your LiteLLM config.yaml 

Define your guardrails under the `guardrails` section

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: {{openai_small}}
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/{{openai_small}}
      api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY

guardrails:
  - guardrail_name: model-armor-shield
    litellm_params:
      guardrail: model_armor
      mode: [pre_call, during_call, post_call]  # Run on input, parallel, and output
      template_id: "your-template-id"  # Required: Your Model Armor template ID
      project_id: "your-project-id"    # Your GCP project ID
      location: "us-central1"          # GCP location (default: us-central1)
      credentials: "path/to/credentials.json"  # Path to service account key
      mask_request_content: true       # Enable request content masking
      mask_response_content: true      # Enable response content masking
      fail_on_error: true             # Fail request if Model Armor errors (default: true)
      sanitize_error_detail: true     # Keep raw Model Armor responses out of errors and logs (default: true)
      default_on: true                # Run by default for all requests
```

#### Supported values for `mode`

- `pre_call` Run **before** LLM call, on **input**
- `during_call` Run **in parallel** with LLM call, on **input**
- `post_call` Run **after** LLM call, on **output**
- `pre_mcp_call` Run **before** an MCP tool call, on **input**
- `during_mcp_call` Run **in parallel** with an MCP tool call, on **input**
- `logging_only` Scan the logged request and completed response without blocking or modifying the client response

#### Observe without blocking

Use `logging_only` to evaluate a Model Armor template before enforcing it:

```yaml
guardrails:
  - guardrail_name: model-armor-observe
    litellm_params:
      guardrail: model_armor
      mode: logging_only
      template_id: "your-template-id"
      project_id: "your-project-id"
      location: "us-central1"
      credentials: "path/to/credentials.json"
      default_on: true
```

For successful Chat Completions, Responses, and Messages calls through the proxy, this mode scans logged request and response text. It records `success`, `guardrail_flagged`, or `guardrail_failed_to_respond` in `guardrail_information`. Inspect the verdict in Request Logs or the Guardrails Monitor Logs tab. Findings and Model Armor errors do not block the request or change the client response. For streaming requests, LiteLLM forwards chunks without waiting for the completed response scan.

This mode has no input-only or output-only selection. Tool-call arguments and inline documents are not scanned. Use `pre_call` or `during_call` for [document and file scanning](#document-and-file-scanning).

### 2. Start LiteLLM Gateway 


```shell
litellm --config config.yaml --detailed_debug
```

### 3. Test request 

**[Langchain, OpenAI SDK Usage Examples](/docs/proxy/user_keys#request-format)**

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-npnwjPQciVRok5yNZgKmFQ" \
  -d '{
    "model": "{{openai_small}}",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, my email is test@example.com"}
    ],
    "guardrails": ["model-armor-shield"]
  }'
```

## Document and File Scanning

As of v1.92.0, Model Armor scans inline document attachments in addition to message text. On `pre_call` and `during_call`, LiteLLM resolves each attachment in the request messages to bytes and submits it to Model Armor's [byte API](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/sanitize-prompts-responses) before the request reaches the LLM.

LiteLLM recognizes OpenAI `type: file` content blocks with inline `file_data` (a base64 data URI or raw base64) and Anthropic `type: document` blocks with an inline base64 `source`. The attachment's MIME type, declared `format`, or filename extension is mapped to a Model Armor `byteDataType`; PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, CSV, and plain text documents are scanned. Inline content of types the byte API does not support, such as images, is not scanned and passes through.

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {"type": "text", "text": "Summarize this document"},
    {"type": "file", "file": {"file_data": "data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0x...", "filename": "report.pdf"}}
  ]
}
```

A Model Armor finding on a document always blocks the request with an HTTP 400:

```json
{"error": "Content blocked by Model Armor", "model_armor_response": {"sanitizationResult": {"filterMatchState": "MATCH_FOUND"}}}
```

Masking never applies to documents. Model Armor returns findings for a document rather than a sanitized copy, so a match blocks even when `mask_request_content` is enabled.

### Attachments That Cannot Be Scanned

An attachment LiteLLM recognizes as a document but cannot submit for scanning fails closed: the request is blocked with an HTTP 400 unless you set `fail_on_error: false`.

| Case | Default (`fail_on_error: true`) | With `fail_on_error: false` |
|------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `file_id` or remote URL reference (`http://`, `https://`, `gs://`) with no inline bytes | Blocked | Passes through unscanned |
| Document larger than Model Armor's 4 MB limit | Blocked | Passes through unscanned |
| Inline base64 that fails to decode | Blocked | Passes through unscanned |
| Model Armor API error while scanning an attachment | Blocked | Attachment skipped, remaining attachments still scanned |

Blocked requests return the reason:

```json
{"error": "Model Armor could not scan an attachment and blocked the request: attachment of 5242880 bytes exceeds Model Armor's 4194304 byte scan limit"}
```

If you use `file_id`, `gs://`, or `http(s)://` attachment references (the pattern Vertex AI recommends), the bytes never reach LiteLLM, so Model Armor cannot scan them and the request is blocked by default. Set `skip_unscannable_attachments: true` to let attachments that carry no inline bytes pass through unscanned while still scanning the ones that do. Unlike `fail_on_error: false`, this leaves fail-closed behavior on real Model Armor API errors (network, quota, bad template) intact; it only affects attachments there is nothing to send.

A document larger than Model Armor's 4 MB byte limit does carry bytes but exceeds what the byte API accepts, so it stays fail-closed under `fail_on_error`; `skip_unscannable_attachments` does not cover it, since that is a real document you likely want blocked rather than forwarded unscanned.

## Supported Params 

### Common Params

- `default_on` - bool - Whether to run the guardrail by default. Default is `false`.
- `mode` - Union[str, list[str]] - Required mode to run the guardrail. Supported values: `pre_call`, `during_call`, `post_call`, `pre_mcp_call`, `during_mcp_call`, and `logging_only`.

### Model Armor Specific

- `template_id` - str - The ID of your Model Armor template (required)

Default is `false`
- `sanitize_error_detail` - bool - Keep the raw Model Armor API response out of caller-facing error details, debug logs, and guardrail trace payloads. Default is `true`; set `false` to restore verbose output for debugging

# MCP Server Submissions

LiteLLM supports a submission and approval workflow for MCP servers. Team members can submit MCP servers for admin review, and the server is held in a `pending_review` state until an admin approves or rejects it.

This lets organizations give team members self-service MCP registration without immediately exposing unapproved servers to all users.

- [MCP Permission Management](./mcp_control.md) - Control MCP access by key, team, or org

## How It Works

```
Team member submits MCP server via API
        ↓
Server saved as "pending_review" (NOT loaded into registry)
        ↓
Admin reviews in the Submitted MCPs tab
        ↓
Approve → server goes "active" and is loaded into the registry
Reject  → server stays out with optional review notes
```

**Prerequisites:**
- `store_model_in_db: true` must be set in your proxy config (required to persist MCP servers)
- The submitting user must use a **team-scoped API key** (admin keys bypass the workflow and use `POST /v1/mcp/server` directly)

```yaml title="config.yaml" showLineNumbers
general_settings:
  store_model_in_db: true
```

## User: Submit an MCP Server

Use a team-scoped API key. Admin keys are rejected at this endpoint; admins should use `POST /v1/mcp/server` directly.

**Response.** The server is created in `pending_review` state:

```json
{
  "server_id": "832d6abc-7a5c-457a-a9f6-cfe4ae05f776",
  "server_name": "github_mcp",
  "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp",
  "transport": "sse",
  "approval_status": "pending_review",
  "submitted_by": "7fd77c87-207b-4d6c-9d51-b72efb8962dc",
  "submitted_at": "2026-04-29T18:50:34Z"
}
```

:::note
The server is **not** accessible to MCP clients yet. It only becomes active after an admin approves it.

## Admin: Review Submissions

### Via UI

Go to **MCP Servers → Submitted MCPs** tab. You'll see:
- Submission counts: Total Submitted, Pending Review, Active, Rejected
- Each submission card with server name, description, URL, transport, and submission date
- **Approve** and **Reject** buttons on each card

<Image
  img={require('../static/img/mcp/02_submitted_mcps_tab.png')}
  style={{width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: '1rem 0'}}
/>

**Approving** a server pops a confirmation dialog. Click **Approve** to make it active and load it into the MCP registry immediately.

<Image
  img={require('../static/img/mcp/04_approve_dialog.png')}
  style={{width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: '1rem 0'}}
/>

After approval, the card badge changes to **Active** and the counters update:

<Image

  style={{width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: '1rem 0'}}
/>

**Rejecting** opens a dialog with an optional review notes field, where you can explain why the submission was declined:

  style={{width: '100%', display: 'block', margin: '1rem 0'}}
/>

### Via API

Admin or `proxy_admin_viewer` role required.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="list" label="List submissions">

```bash title="List all MCP submissions" showLineNumbers
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/mcp/server/submissions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "total": 1,
  "pending_review": 1,
  "active": 0,
  "rejected": 0,
  "items": [
    {
      "server_id": "832d6abc-7a5c-457a-a9f6-cfe4ae05f776",
      "server_name": "github_mcp",
      "approval_status": "pending_review",
      "submitted_by": "7fd77c87-207b-4d6c-9d51-b72efb8962dc",
      "submitted_at": "2026-04-29T18:50:34Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="approve" label="Approve">

```bash title="Approve a submitted MCP server" showLineNumbers
curl -X PUT http://localhost:4000/v1/mcp/server/{server_id}/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

The server status changes to `active` and it is immediately loaded into the MCP runtime registry.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="reject" label="Reject">

```bash title="Reject a submitted MCP server" showLineNumbers
curl -X PUT http://localhost:4000/v1/mcp/server/{server_id}/reject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"review_notes": "This URL is not on the approved vendor list."}'
```

`review_notes` is optional. The server stays out of the registry.

## Approval Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending_review` | Submitted, waiting for admin review. Not accessible to MCP clients. |
| `active` | Approved. Loaded into the MCP registry and available to clients. |
| `rejected` | Rejected by admin. Not accessible. May include `review_notes`. |

---

## FAQ

**Can an admin re-approve a rejected server?**

Yes. Call `PUT /v1/mcp/server/{id}/approve`; the endpoint accepts servers in both `pending_review` and `rejected` status.

**What happens if a previously-active server is rejected?**

It is evicted from the runtime registry immediately, so clients will no longer see its tools.

**Do I need a special config flag to enable submissions?**

No. The submission endpoints are available by default as long as `store_model_in_db: true` is set. No additional feature flags are required.

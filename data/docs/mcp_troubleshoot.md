# MCP Troubleshooting Guide

When LiteLLM acts as an MCP gateway, traffic flows `Client -> LiteLLM Proxy -> MCP Server`, and OAuth-enabled setups add an authorization server for metadata discovery. This page is a symptom-to-fix runbook: run one diagnostic, match the symptom in the matrix, and follow the row to the fix. If you still need to escalate, collect the [support bundle](#support-bundle) so nobody has to reconstruct context later

For provisioning steps and configuration fields, refer to [mcp.md](./mcp.md). For choosing endpoints, transports, and auth patterns, see the [MCP Configuration Reference](./mcp_config_reference)

## Five-Minute Triage {#locate-the-error-source}

Every command on this page uses the quickstart conventions: proxy at `http://localhost:4000`, LiteLLM key in `x-litellm-api-key`, and a server alias like `deepwiki` from `mcp_servers` in `config.yaml`. Substitute your own host, key, and alias

Step 1: run the diagnostic below against the named endpoint for the failing server. It keeps the HTTP status, response headers, and body, which is all the evidence you need. Do not pipe it through `grep`, you will throw away the part that identifies the layer

```bash
curl -sS -D - -X POST http://localhost:4000/deepwiki/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "x-litellm-api-key: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-litellm-mcp-debug: true" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

Step 2: read the HTTP status line and body, then find your row in the matrix. The status tells you the layer: 401/403/404/405/406 come from LiteLLM before the upstream call (Client -> LiteLLM), while a `200` whose body reports `"status": "unreachable"` or an empty tool list means LiteLLM answered but the upstream hop failed (LiteLLM -> MCP Server)

Step 3: confirm the layer with the `x-mcp-debug-*` response headers (enabled by `x-litellm-mcp-debug: true`, see [debug headers](#debug-headers)) and the matching proxy log line, then apply the fix in the row

A healthy control response looks like this. Get one first, because a working baseline is what makes every failure below interpretable:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: text/event-stream

event: message
data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"_meta":{"litellm.ai/server_outcomes":{"deepwiki":{"status":"ok","tool_count":3}}},"tools":[{"name":"deepwiki-ask_question",...}]}}
```

## Symptom Matrix

| Symptom | Likely layer | Diagnostic | Expected evidence | Fix | Escalate with |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `401` `Authentication Error, Malformed API Key` | Client -> LiteLLM | Diagnostic curl without/with the key header | `{"detail":"Authentication Error, Malformed API Key passed in. Ensure Key has 'Bearer ' prefix."}` | Send `x-litellm-api-key: Bearer <key>`, prefix included | Full status + body, [bundle](#support-bundle) |
| `401` invalid or expired key | Client -> LiteLLM | Diagnostic curl; check `x-mcp-debug-inbound-auth` | 401 body naming the key; debug header shows the masked key the proxy saw | Use a live virtual key or the master key; regenerate if expired | Masked key ID, key creation time |
| `403` key valid but not allowed | LiteLLM auth/routing | Diagnostic curl against the named endpoint | 403 body citing team/key MCP permissions | Grant the key/team access to the server or [access group](./mcp_control.md) | Key/team config subset |
| `404` `MCP server, toolset, or access group '<alias>' not found` | LiteLLM auth/routing | Diagnostic curl to `/<alias>/mcp` | Exact 404 body naming the alias | Fix the alias to match `mcp_servers` in `config.yaml`, or add the server | `mcp_servers` config subset |
| `404` `{"detail":"Not Found"}` | Client -> LiteLLM | Compare the URL against `/<alias>/mcp` | Plain FastAPI 404, no alias named | Add the missing `/mcp` suffix or fix the path | Exact URL used |
| `405` `Method Not Allowed` | Client -> LiteLLM | `curl -sS -D - -X PUT ...` reproduces it | `allow: GET, POST, DELETE` header plus JSON-RPC error body | Use POST for JSON-RPC calls; the endpoint speaks streamable HTTP, not SSE-only or WebSocket | Method + transport client config |
| `406` `Not Acceptable` | Client -> LiteLLM | Diagnostic curl without the `Accept` header | `Client must accept both application/json and text/event-stream` | Send `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` | Client HTTP config |
| `400` on UI OAuth Connect: `{"detail":"invalid_request"}` | LiteLLM auth/routing | See [OAuth redirect_uri rejected](#mcp-oauth-invalid-request) | Log line `MCP OAuth: rejecting redirect_uri ...` | Set `PROXY_BASE_URL` or trust `X-Forwarded-*` | `.well-known` issuer output |
| OAuth flow sends LiteLLM key upstream | LiteLLM auth/routing | Diagnostic curl, read `x-mcp-debug-oauth2-token` | `SAME_AS_LITELLM_KEY` in the header | Move the LiteLLM key to `x-litellm-api-key` so `Authorization` stays free for the upstream token, see [Debugging OAuth](./mcp_oauth#debugging-oauth) | Debug headers |
| Client cannot register (DCR) or discovery fails | LiteLLM auth/routing | `curl -sS http://localhost:4000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | JSON with `authorization_endpoint` and `token_endpoint` | Verify metadata is reachable from the client; check [OAuth docs](./mcp_oauth) for supported grants | Metadata JSON, client error verbatim |
| `200` but `"status": "unreachable"`, empty tools | LiteLLM -> MCP Server | Diagnostic curl + proxy log grep for the alias | Log: `httpx.ConnectError: All connection attempts failed` (network) or `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` (TLS) | Fix the upstream URL, network path, firewall, or the server's certificate | Proxy log lines + MCP-server logs |
| `200` but tool list empty on aggregate `/mcp` | LiteLLM -> MCP Server | Read `litellm.ai/server_outcomes` in the body | Per-server `status` shows which upstream failed and which returned tools | Fix the failing server; aggregate absorbs per-server failures instead of failing the whole list | `server_outcomes` object |
| Tool call fails: `Tool '<name>' not found` | Client -> LiteLLM | `tools/call` with the exact name from `tools/list` | `{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Error: Tool 'nonexistent_tool' not found"}],"isError":true}` | Use the prefixed name (`deepwiki-ask_question`) on aggregate and named endpoints alike | `tools/list` output |
| `/v1/responses` or `/v1/chat/completions` ignores MCP tools | LiteLLM auth/routing | Compare `server_label` to your config alias | Success shows `mcp_tools_fetched` and `tool_execution_results` output items; a wrong label produces a plain answer with no tool items | Set `server_label` to the exact alias and `server_url` to `litellm_proxy` | Full request body (redacted) + response |
| Timeouts mid-request | LiteLLM -> MCP Server | Time the diagnostic curl; check MCP-server logs | Curl hangs then errors; proxy log shows the timeout | Raise client timeout, check upstream latency and network path | Timestamps both sides, topology |

## Endpoints and Sessions

LiteLLM exposes one aggregate endpoint and one named endpoint per server. `POST /mcp` lists tools from every server your key can access, with each tool prefixed by its server alias (`deepwiki-ask_question`) and a per-server `litellm.ai/server_outcomes` report in `_meta`. `POST /<alias>/mcp` scopes the call to one server and is the right target for triage, because an aggregate response can hide one failing server behind other healthy ones

The endpoints speak MCP streamable HTTP. Responses arrive as `text/event-stream` frames even for single JSON-RPC calls, which is why the `Accept` header must allow both content types. Plain `tools/list` and `tools/call` requests work without a prior `initialize` handshake, so curl triage needs no session setup. MCP clients that do run `initialize` get a session; if a client fails before listing tools, capture its very first HTTP exchange, since transport mismatches (405) and missing `Accept` headers (406) happen on that first request

## Verified Failure Modes

Every response below was captured against a live proxy with the quickstart config and a `deepwiki` server, plus deliberately broken servers for the network and TLS rows

### 401 and 403: authentication {#auth-failures}

Missing or malformed key:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
{"detail":"Authentication Error, Malformed API Key passed in. Ensure Key has `Bearer ` prefix."}
```

An unknown or expired key also returns 401, with a body naming the rejected key:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
{"detail":"Authentication Error, Invalid proxy server token passed. Received API Key = sk-..., Key Hash (Token) =2ab06c... Unable to find token in cache or `LiteLLM_VerificationTokenTable`"}
```

A 403 means the key authenticated but lacks MCP permissions for that server; fix the key/team [permission assignment](./mcp_control.md) rather than the credential

### 404: server or route {#server-route-404}

Unknown alias, LiteLLM routing rejected it:

```text
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
{"detail":"MCP server, toolset, or access group 'nosuchserver' not found"}
```

Wrong path (missing `/mcp` suffix), the request never reached MCP routing:

```text
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
{"detail":"Not Found"}
```

The two bodies look similar but mean different things: the first is a config/alias problem, the second is a URL problem

### 405 and 406: transport or endpoint mismatch {#transport-mismatch}

A non-JSON-RPC method (for example PUT) returns 405 with the allowed methods:

```text
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
allow: GET, POST, DELETE
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"server-error","error":{"code":-32600,"message":"Method Not Allowed"}}
```

Omitting the `Accept` header returns 406:

```text
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"server-error","error":{"code":-32600,"message":"Not Acceptable: Client must accept both application/json and text/event-stream"}}
```

Both indicate the client's transport configuration, not the upstream server. GET on the endpoint opens a streamable HTTP event stream (you will see `: ping` keepalives), which is expected behavior, not an error

### OAuth discovery, DCR, and redirects {#oauth-issues}

Confirm the proxy publishes OAuth metadata before debugging any client flow:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:4000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

```text
{"issuer":"http://localhost:4000","authorization_endpoint":"http://localhost:4000/v1/mcp/oauth/authorize","token_endpoint":"http://localhost:4000/v1/mcp/oauth/token","response_types_supported":["code"],"grant_types_supported":["authorization_code"],"code_challenge_methods_supported":["S256"]}
```

The `issuer` must match the origin users type into their browser. If it shows an internal hostname behind an ingress, see the redirect_uri section below. For token flow debugging, `SAME_AS_LITELLM_KEY` in `x-mcp-debug-oauth2-token` means the LiteLLM key is leaking upstream instead of an OAuth token; see [Debugging OAuth](./mcp_oauth#debugging-oauth)

#### MCP OAuth: Connect returns `{"detail":"invalid_request"}` {#mcp-oauth-invalid-request}

**Symptom.** Clicking **Connect** on an MCP OAuth server in the LiteLLM UI returns:

```text
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
{"detail":"invalid_request"}
```

The proxy logs (with verbose logging) show a line like `MCP OAuth: rejecting redirect_uri ... as invalid_request. Computed proxy base=...`

**Cause.** The `/v1/mcp/server/oauth/{server_id}/authorize` endpoint validates that the browser-supplied `redirect_uri` (`https://llm.example.com/ui/mcp/oauth/callback`) shares scheme + host + port with the proxy's own public origin. Behind a TLS-terminating ingress (Kubernetes, ALB, nginx, Cloudflare, etc.) the proxy resolves to its internal address (`http://<pod-ip>:4000`) by default, so the same-origin check rejects

**Diagnostic.** Compare what the proxy advertises as its origin to what the browser sees:

```bash
curl -sS https://llm.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server | jq .issuer
```

The `issuer` value should equal the origin the user types into their browser (`https://llm.example.com`). If it returns an internal hostname or `http://...`, the proxy's resolved origin is wrong

**Fixes**, in order of preference:

1. **Set `PROXY_BASE_URL`** (recommended). Operator declares the proxy's true public origin out of band, no header trust required:

   ```bash
   PROXY_BASE_URL=https://llm.example.com
   ```

   Full origin only: scheme + host (+ port if non-default), no trailing slash, no path. See [Reverse proxy and ingress configuration](./mcp_oauth#reverse-proxy-and-ingress-configuration)

2. **Trust `X-Forwarded-*` from your ingress.** Set both keys in `general_settings`:

   ```yaml title="config.yaml" showLineNumbers
   general_settings:
     use_x_forwarded_for: true
     mcp_trusted_proxy_ranges:
       - "10.0.0.0/8"      # your ingress / load-balancer CIDR(s)
   ```

   `use_x_forwarded_for` alone is not enough. Without `mcp_trusted_proxy_ranges`, the proxy refuses to honor `X-Forwarded-*` because it cannot tell a trusted reverse proxy from a direct attacker. Verify that your ingress sends `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and (when running on a non-default port) `X-Forwarded-Port`

3. **Fix the ingress.** If the ingress is stripping or rewriting `X-Forwarded-*`, no proxy setting will help; restore the headers at the ingress layer

For an approved OAuth client on a separate domain, such as an internal web application, add the callback host to `MCP_TRUSTED_REDIRECT_ORIGINS`. See [Allowing additional first-party redirect_uri origins](./mcp_oauth#allowing-additional-first-party-redirect_uri-origins).

For pre-registered OAuth applications, see [Redirect URLs for static OAuth clients](./mcp_oauth#static-client-redirect-urls) for IdP callback configuration, MCP client callback requirements, and validation errors.

For Dynamic Client Registration failures, collect the client's error response and the authorization server metadata shown above. The metadata lists the supported grant types.

### Network, TLS, and timeouts {#network-tls-timeouts}

An unreachable upstream does not surface as a gateway 502. The named endpoint returns 200 with an empty tool list and a per-server status:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
event: message
data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"_meta":{"litellm.ai/server_outcomes":{"brokenserver":{"status":"unreachable"}}},"tools":[]}}
```

The proxy log identifies which failure class it was. Connection refused or DNS:

```text
09:00:34 - LiteLLM:WARNING: mcp_server_manager.py - Error listing tools from brokenserver: All connection attempts failed
httpx.ConnectError: All connection attempts failed
```

TLS failure (expired or untrusted certificate):

```text
09:01:40 - LiteLLM:WARNING: mcp_server_manager.py - Error listing tools from tlsbroken: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: certificate has expired (_ssl.c:1000)
```

For timeouts, time the diagnostic curl and compare timestamps between proxy and MCP-server logs to see which side stalled

### Empty tool lists and tool naming {#empty-tools}

On the aggregate `/mcp` endpoint, one broken server does not fail the request. Healthy servers still return tools and `litellm.ai/server_outcomes` reports each server separately:

```text
data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"_meta":{"litellm.ai/server_outcomes":{"deepwiki":{"status":"ok","tool_count":3},"brokenserver":{"status":"unreachable"}}},"tools":[{"name":"deepwiki-ask_question",...}]}}
```

If the whole list is empty, check `server_outcomes` for the failing status per server rather than guessing. Tool names are prefixed with the server alias, so call `deepwiki-ask_question`, not `ask_question`. Calling an unprefixed or wrong name fails inside the tool result, not at the HTTP layer:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Error: Tool 'nonexistent_tool' not found"}],"isError":true}}
```

### Responses and Chat Completions failures {#responsescompletions-with-embedded-mcp-calls}

During `/v1/responses` or `/v1/chat/completions`, LiteLLM executes MCP tool calls mid-request when the request includes an MCP tool with `server_url: "litellm_proxy"`. A working request shows the MCP hop explicitly in the output items:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:4000/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "input": "List the top-level wiki pages for BerriAI/litellm",
    "tools": [{"type": "mcp", "server_label": "deepwiki", "server_url": "litellm_proxy", "require_approval": "never"}]
  }'
```

Success contains `mcp_tools_fetched` and `tool_execution_results` items alongside the assistant message. If `server_label` does not match any configured alias, the request still returns 200 but those items are absent and the model answers without tools; that silent degradation is the symptom to look for. The same applies to `/v1/chat/completions` with the identical `tools` array. If the tool items are present but the tool result contains an error, jump to the row for that error (unknown tool name, upstream unreachable) since the embedded call goes through the same MCP path as a direct curl

## Debug Headers {#debug-headers}

Add `x-litellm-mcp-debug: true` to any MCP request to get masked diagnostic response headers:

```text
x-mcp-debug-inbound-auth: x-litellm-api-key=Bearer****1234
x-mcp-debug-oauth2-token: (none)
x-mcp-debug-auth-resolution: no-auth
x-mcp-debug-outbound-url: https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp
x-mcp-debug-server-auth-type: (none)
```

`x-mcp-debug-auth-resolution` tells you how LiteLLM resolved outbound auth: `oauth2-passthrough`, `m2m-client-credentials`, `per-request-header`, `static-token`, or `no-auth`. `x-mcp-debug-outbound-url` confirms which upstream the proxy actually called. Values are masked, so the headers are safe to include in a support bundle

For Claude Code, add the debug header to your MCP config:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http my_server http://localhost:4000/deepwiki/mcp \
  --header "x-litellm-api-key: Bearer sk-..." \
  --header "x-litellm-mcp-debug: true"
```

## Verify Connectivity

### MCP Inspector

Use the MCP Inspector when you need to test both `Client -> LiteLLM` and `Client -> MCP` communications in one place; it makes isolating the failing hop straightforward

1. Execute `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` on your workstation.
2. Configure and connect:
   - **Transport Type:** choose the transport the client uses (Streamable HTTP for LiteLLM).
   - **URL:** the endpoint under test (LiteLLM MCP URL for `Client -> LiteLLM`, or the MCP server URL for `Client -> MCP`).
   - **Custom Headers:** e.g., `x-litellm-api-key: Bearer <LiteLLM API Key>`.
3. Open the **Tools** tab and click **List Tools** to verify the MCP alias responds.

### `curl` Smoke Test

`curl` is ideal on servers where installing the Inspector is impractical. It replicates the MCP tool call LiteLLM would make; swap in the domain of the system under test (LiteLLM or the MCP server)

```bash
curl -sS -D - -X POST https://your-target-domain.example.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

Add `-H "x-litellm-api-key: Bearer <LiteLLM API Key>"` when the target is a LiteLLM endpoint that requires authentication. Matching failures between `curl` and LiteLLM confirm that the MCP server or network/OAuth layer is the culprit. Testing the MCP server directly from the LiteLLM host rules the network path in or out

### LiteLLM UI / Playground

Failures shown on the MCP creation form or within the MCP Tool Testing Playground mean the LiteLLM proxy cannot reach the MCP server. Typical causes are misconfiguration (transport, headers, credentials), MCP/server outages, network/firewall blocks, or inaccessible OAuth metadata. Reproducing a client failure in the Playground confirms the problem is on the LiteLLM -> MCP hop rather than in the client

## Review Logs

Well-scoped logs make it clear whether LiteLLM reached the MCP server and what happened next

### Access Log Example (successful MCP call)

```text
INFO:     127.0.0.1:57230 - "POST /deepwiki/mcp HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

### Error Log Example (failed MCP call)

```text
07:22:00 - LiteLLM:ERROR: client.py:224 - MCP client list_tools failed - Error Type: ExceptionGroup, Error: unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (1 sub-exception), Server: http://localhost:3001/mcp, Transport: MCPTransport.http
  httpcore.ConnectError: All connection attempts failed
ERROR:LiteLLM:MCP client list_tools failed - Error Type: ExceptionGroup, Error: unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (1 sub-exception)...
  httpx.ConnectError: All connection attempts failed
```

## Support Bundle {#support-bundle}

If the matrix did not resolve the issue, collect everything below in one pass. A complete bundle replaces the discovery call where support reconstructs your setup

1. LiteLLM version: `curl -sS http://localhost:4000/health/readiness` output or the image tag.
2. Config subset: the `mcp_servers` block and any `general_settings` keys touching MCP or forwarding, with secrets removed.
3. The exact failing request: full curl command with the key masked (`sk-****1234`).
4. HTTP status line, response headers, and body from the diagnostic curl (the `-D -` output, unfiltered).
5. `x-mcp-debug-*` headers from a run with `x-litellm-mcp-debug: true` (already masked).
6. LiteLLM proxy logs covering the failing request, started with `--detailed_debug` if possible.
7. MCP-server logs for the same time window.
8. Topology: where the client, LiteLLM, ingress/load balancer, and MCP server run, and what TLS terminates where.
9. Timestamps with timezone for each captured request so logs can be correlated.

Never share: raw LiteLLM virtual keys or the master key, upstream API keys or static tokens from `mcp_servers` auth config, OAuth client secrets, unmasked `Authorization` header values, or `.env` contents. The masked debug headers exist so you never need to paste a live credential

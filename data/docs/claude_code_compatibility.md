# Claude Code × LiteLLM compatibility matrix

This table is regenerated daily by an automated populator that runs the
[Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) against
the newest final LiteLLM release (the latest bare `vX.Y.Z` tag) across each
supported provider, with Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, and Opus 4.7 in parallel. A
cell goes green only if all three model tiers pass.

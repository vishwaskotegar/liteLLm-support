- **One-click setup.** Configure automatically checks the models your proxy already serves and fills all four tiers for you; no template to pick.
- **One model name in your clients.** The gateway classifies each request and picks the model.
- **Any model, any provider, per tier.** A single model, a random pool, or a Thompson-sampled pool.
- **Classifier choices.** Heuristics, an LLM, JEV through TypeSafe System One Choice, keyword rules, or a custom plugin
- **Savings reported per request.** Against an all-frontier baseline, in the logs and in Cost Optimization.
- **Agent-safe.** Prompt caching, context-window escalation, modality routing, mid-task stall escalation, and optional session pinning.

## Results

| Result | Measured on | Read more |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JEV: 5.43x as fast as Haiku by median classification latency and 96.12% lower registry-priced classifier cost | 80 authored synthetic cases, three paired repeats, 95.00% vs 73.75% match with authored expected tiers under one fixed rubric | [JEV comparison](/blog/jev-auto-router-benchmark) |
| Claude Opus-5 solve rate at 27% lower cost | 21-task subset of Terminal-Bench 2.0, 16/21 solved by both | [Terminal-Bench](/blog/auto-router-terminal-bench-benchmark) |
| Heuristic v2: 27% more tasks solved at 45% lower cost per task than v1 | Same 21-task subset, no LLM classifier call | [Heuristic v2](/blog/heuristic-v2) |
| 74.5% cheaper at 87.3% of frontier quality | RouterArena, 8,399 graded queries | [Cost and quality](/blog/auto-router-cost-quality-benchmark) |
| 51.1% saved, $12,249 over four months | 272,876 production requests, 450+ users | [Production case study](/blog/auto-router-production-savings) |
| 37% to 69% cheaper than caching alone | Five datasets including live gateway traffic | [Prompt caching](/blog/auto-router-prompt-caching-benchmark) |
| Matched or beat the current model on 88.1% of responses | Shadow evaluation on live traffic, 143 judged turns | [Shadow evaluations](/blog/auto-router-shadow-evaluations) |

## Quick start

- **Dashboard:** Models + Endpoints, Add Model, Auto Router tab, enter a name, then click **Configure automatically** or pick a template. Review the tiers, Test Routing, and save.
- **Agent:** tell it `run curl -fsSL https://docs.litellm.ai/skills/auto-router and follow the instructions`.
- **config.yaml:** one router entry whose tiers name other models in the same file.

```yaml title="config.yaml" keep-model-ids
model_list:
  - model_name: claude-haiku-4-5
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
      api_key: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - model_name: claude-sonnet-5
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
      api_key: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - model_name: claude-opus-5
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-opus-5
      api_key: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

  - model_name: smart-router
    litellm_params:
      model: auto_router/complexity_router
      complexity_router_config:
        tiers:
          SIMPLE:    claude-haiku-4-5
          MEDIUM:    claude-sonnet-5
          COMPLEX:   claude-opus-5
          REASONING: claude-opus-5
        classifier_type: heuristic
      complexity_router_default_model: claude-sonnet-5
```

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "smart-router", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}]}'
```

## Explore

To use TypeSafe System One for classification, choose `classifier_type: jev` and configure `jev_classifier_config`. Start with [JEV setup](/docs/auto_router/setup#jev-classifier-typesafe-ai) and review its [context, fallback and accounting](/docs/proxy/auto_routing#jev-classifier)

# Langfuse

## What is Langfuse?

Langfuse ([GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)) is an open-source LLM engineering platform for model [tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing), [prompt management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started), and application [evaluation](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview). Langfuse helps teams to collaboratively debug, analyze, and iterate on their LLM applications. 


Example trace in Langfuse using multiple models via LiteLLM:

:::tip[Recommended: Use OpenTelemetry v2]

For Langfuse v3 and v4, we recommend using the `langfuse_otel` preset in the [OpenTelemetry v2 guide](./opentelemetry_v2#2-send-traces-to-a-specific-tool-presets). This provides better span quality, lower latency, and native OpenTelemetry semantics.

The SDK callback below (`langfuse`) requires the Langfuse Python SDK v4 (`langfuse>=4.7,<5`). It exports traces through LiteLLM's own OpenTelemetry pipeline to Langfuse's OTLP endpoint, so traces appear in near real time, and uses the SDK's REST client only for prompt management and credential checks. Batch size and prompt cache TTL are tuned with `LANGFUSE_FLUSH_AT` and `LANGFUSE_PROMPT_CACHE_DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS` (see [config settings](../proxy/config_settings)).

Self-hosted Langfuse must be on server 3.63.0 or newer for SDK v4, per the [Langfuse compatibility matrix](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/upgrade/versioning#sdk-server); OSS v2 servers do not serve the `/api/public/otel/v1/traces` route the callback exports to, so traces are rejected with a 404 and the proxy logs the rejection. Upgrade the server before upgrading LiteLLM, or keep the previous LiteLLM version until then. An ingress or reverse proxy with a request body limit in front of Langfuse answers 413 to a large batch; the callback splits that batch in halves and resends, and only a single span that alone exceeds the limit is dropped, with an error log.

## Usage with LiteLLM Proxy (LLM Gateway)

👉 [**Follow this link to start sending logs to langfuse with LiteLLM Proxy server**](../proxy/logging)

To route different teams or virtual keys to different Langfuse projects, see [Team/Key Based Logging](../proxy/team_logging). Team defaults live in trusted `config.yaml` (where `os.environ/...` references are resolved by the gateway), while per-key callbacks are provisioned via `/key/generate` or `/key/update` with resolved credential values; these are stored settings on the key, not per-request credentials.


## Usage with LiteLLM Python SDK

:::note

This section covers the `langfuse` callback, which uses the Langfuse Python SDK v4. Alternatively, you can use the [OpenTelemetry v2 integration](./opentelemetry_v2#2-send-traces-to-a-specific-tool-presets) directly.

### Pre-Requisites
Ensure you have run `uv add langfuse` for this integration
```shell
uv add "langfuse>=4.7,<5" litellm
```

### Quick Start
Use just 2 lines of code, to instantly log your responses **across all providers** with Langfuse:

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/cookbook/logging_observability/LiteLLM_Langfuse.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

Get your Langfuse API Keys from https://cloud.langfuse.com/
```python
litellm.success_callback = ["langfuse"]
litellm.failure_callback = ["langfuse"] # logs errors to langfuse
```
```python
# uv add langfuse 
import litellm
import os

# from https://cloud.langfuse.com/
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = ""
# Optional, defaults to https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] # optional

# LLM API Keys
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']=""

# set langfuse as a callback, litellm will send the data to langfuse
litellm.success_callback = ["langfuse"] 
 
# openai call
response = litellm.completion(
  model="{{openai_small}}",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi 👋 - i'm openai"}
  ]
)
```

### Advanced
#### Set Custom Generation Names, pass Metadata

Pass `generation_name` in `metadata`

```python
import litellm
from litellm import completion
import os

# from https://cloud.langfuse.com/
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-..."


# OpenAI and Cohere keys 
# You can use any of the litellm supported providers: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']="sk-..."

# set langfuse as a callback, litellm will send the data to langfuse
litellm.success_callback = ["langfuse"] 
 
# openai call
response = completion(
  model="{{openai_small}}",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi 👋 - i'm openai"}
  ],
  metadata = {
    "generation_name": "litellm-ishaan-gen", # set langfuse generation name
    # custom metadata fields
    "project": "litellm-proxy" 
  }
)
 
print(response)

```

#### Set Custom Trace ID, Trace User ID, Trace Metadata, Trace Version, Trace Release and Tags

Pass `trace_id`, `trace_user_id`, `trace_metadata`, `trace_version`, `trace_release`, `tags` in `metadata`


```python
import litellm
from litellm import completion
import os

# from https://cloud.langfuse.com/
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-..."

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']="sk-..."

# set langfuse as a callback, litellm will send the data to langfuse
litellm.success_callback = ["langfuse"] 

# set custom langfuse trace params and generation params
response = completion(
  model="{{openai_small}}",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi 👋 - i'm openai"}
  ],
  metadata={
      "generation_name": "ishaan-test-generation",  # set langfuse Generation Name
      "generation_id": "gen-id22",                  # set langfuse Generation ID 
      "parent_observation_id": "obs-id9",           # set langfuse Parent Observation ID
      "version":  "test-generation-version",        # set langfuse Generation Version
      "trace_user_id": "user-id2",                  # set langfuse Trace User ID
      "session_id": "session-1",                    # set langfuse Session ID
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],                     # set langfuse Tags
      "trace_name": "new-trace-name",               # set langfuse Trace Name
      "trace_id": "trace-id22",                     # set langfuse Trace ID (non-hex IDs are deterministically hashed, see note below)
      "trace_metadata": {"key": "value"},           # set langfuse Trace Metadata
      "trace_version": "test-trace-version",        # set langfuse Version. v4 has a single version attribute - on a new trace, trace_version takes precedence over version
      "trace_release": "test-trace-release",        # set langfuse Trace Release
      ### OR ### 
      "existing_trace_id": "trace-id22",            # if generation is continuation of past trace. This prevents default behaviour of setting a trace name
      ### OR enforce that certain fields are trace overwritten in the trace during the continuation ###
      "existing_trace_id": "trace-id22",
      "trace_metadata": {"key": "updated_trace_value"},            # The new value to use for the langfuse Trace Metadata
      "update_trace_keys": ["input", "output", "trace_metadata"],  # Updates the trace input & output to be this generations input & output (written via observation fields in v4) and updates the Trace Metadata to match the passed in value. Requires `langfuse_enable_update_trace_keys: true`
      "debug_langfuse": True,                                      # Will log the scalar metadata sent to litellm for the trace/generation as `metadata_passed_to_litellm` 
  },
)

print(response)

```

:::info[Langfuse v4 semantics]

- **Custom `trace_id`**: Langfuse v4 requires W3C trace IDs (32 lowercase hex chars). LiteLLM first lowercases your `trace_id` and strips hyphens, so a UUID such as `01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF` becomes `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef` and is used as is. Anything that still isn't 32 hex chars is deterministically hashed to one (via `Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=<your id>)`). The same `trace_id` always maps to the same Langfuse trace, but the ID visible in Langfuse is the normalized or hashed form, not your original string.
- **`version` / `trace_version`**: Langfuse v4 has a single `version` attribute. On a new trace, `trace_version` takes precedence over `version`; on an `existing_trace_id` continuation, `version` still lands on the generation.
- **Continued traces**: the v4 server derives a trace's name/input/output from the latest root observation in the trace. `update_trace_keys` with `input`/`output` is still honored - the values are written via observation fields.

:::

You can also pass `metadata` as part of the request header with a `langfuse_*` prefix:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/chat/completions' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
    --header 'langfuse_trace_id: trace-id2' \
    --header 'langfuse_trace_user_id: user-id2' \
    --header 'langfuse_trace_metadata: {"key":"value"}' \
    --data '{
    "model": "{{openai_small}}",
    "messages": [
        {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "what llm are you"
        }
    ]
}'
```


#### Trace & Generation Parameters

##### Trace Specific Parameters

* `trace_id`       - Identifier for the trace, must use `existing_trace_id` instead of `trace_id` if this is an existing trace, auto-generated by default. IDs are lowercased and stripped of hyphens; anything that still isn't 32 hex chars is deterministically hashed to a 32-hex W3C trace ID (see note above)
* `trace_name`     - Name of the trace, auto-generated by default
* `session_id`     - Session identifier for the trace, defaults to `None`
* `trace_version`  - Version for the trace, defaults to value for `version`. Langfuse v4 has a single `version` attribute: `trace_version` takes precedence on a new trace
* `trace_release`  - Release for the trace, defaults to `None`
* `trace_metadata` - Metadata for the trace, defaults to `None`
* `trace_user_id`  - User identifier for the trace, defaults to completion argument `user`
* `tags`           - Tags for the trace, defaults to `None`

#### Generation Specific Parameters

* `generation_id`         - Identifier for the generation, auto-generated by default
* `generation_name`       - Identifier for the generation, auto-generated by default
* `parent_observation_id` - Identifier for the parent observation, defaults to `None`
* `prompt`                - Langfuse prompt object used for the generation, defaults to `None`


Any other key value pairs passed into the metadata are logged on the generation under `requester_metadata`. On the proxy this happens automatically for whatever you send in the request body. From the SDK, nest them so they are picked up:

```python
response = litellm.completion(
    model="{{openai_large}}",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}],
    metadata={"metadata": {"my_key": "my_value"}},   # arrives as requester_metadata
)
```

#### Multiple Langfuse Projects (Per-Request Credentials)

You can send traces to different Langfuse projects per request by passing credentials directly to `completion()` or `acompletion()`. This works alongside (or instead of) the global env vars and is useful when different teams or business processes use different Langfuse projects.

Pass **`langfuse_public_key`**, **`langfuse_secret_key`** (or **`langfuse_secret`**), and optionally **`langfuse_host`** as keyword arguments:

```python
import litellm
from litellm import completion

# Optional: set a default via env for requests that don't pass credentials
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-default..."
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-default..."

litellm.success_callback = ["langfuse"]
litellm.failure_callback = ["langfuse"]

# Request 1 → Langfuse Project A
response_a = completion(
    model="{{openai_small}}",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from team A"}],
    langfuse_public_key="pk-lf-project-a...",
    langfuse_secret_key="sk-lf-project-a...",
    langfuse_host="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com",  # optional
)

# Request 2 → Langfuse Project B (different project)
response_b = completion(
    model="{{openai_small}}",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from team B"}],
    langfuse_public_key="pk-lf-project-b...",
    langfuse_secret_key="sk-lf-project-b...",
    langfuse_host="https://eu.cloud.langfuse.com",  # optional, can differ per project
)
```

Async usage with per-request credentials:

```python
import litellm
from litellm import acompletion

litellm.success_callback = ["langfuse"]
litellm.failure_callback = ["langfuse"]

response = await acompletion(
    model="{{openai_small}}",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}],
    langfuse_public_key="pk-lf-...",
    langfuse_secret_key="sk-lf-...",
    langfuse_host="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com",  # optional
)
```

- **`langfuse_public_key`** – Langfuse project public key (required for per-request override).
- **`langfuse_secret_key`** or **`langfuse_secret`** – Langfuse secret key (either name is accepted).
- **`langfuse_host`** – Langfuse host URL (e.g. `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`); optional, defaults to env or Langfuse cloud.

When these are passed, that request uses this project (and host) for the Langfuse callback; when omitted, the callback uses the global Langfuse client (from env vars if set). LiteLLM caches a Langfuse client per credential set to avoid creating a new client on every request.

#### Disable Logging - Specific Calls

To disable logging for specific calls use the `no-log` flag. 

`completion(messages = ..., model = ...,  **{"no-log": True})`


### Use LangChain ChatLiteLLM + Langfuse
Pass `trace_user_id`, `session_id` in model_kwargs
```python
import os
from langchain.chat_models import ChatLiteLLM
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage
import litellm

# from https://cloud.langfuse.com/
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-..."

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']="sk-..."

# set langfuse as a callback, litellm will send the data to langfuse
litellm.success_callback = ["langfuse"] 

chat = ChatLiteLLM(
  model="{{openai_small}}",
  model_kwargs={
      "metadata": {
        "trace_user_id": "user-id2", # set langfuse Trace User ID
        "session_id": "session-1" ,  # set langfuse Session ID
        "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"] 
      }
    }
  )
messages = [
    HumanMessage(
        content="what model are you"
    )
]
chat(messages)
```

### Redacting Messages, Response Content from Langfuse Logging 

#### Redact Messages and Responses from all Langfuse Logging

Set `litellm.turn_off_message_logging=True` This will prevent the messages and responses from being logged to langfuse, but request metadata will still be logged.

#### Redact Messages and Responses from specific Langfuse Logging

In the metadata typically passed for text completion or embedding calls you can set specific keys to mask the messages and responses for this call.

Setting `mask_input` to `True` will mask the input from being logged for this call 

Setting `mask_output` to `True` will make the output from being logged for this call.

Be aware that if you are continuing an existing trace, and you set `update_trace_keys` to include either `input` or `output` and you set the corresponding `mask_input` or `mask_output`, then that trace will have its existing input and/or output replaced with a redacted message. This applies only when `langfuse_enable_update_trace_keys` is on.

## Troubleshooting & Errors
### Data not getting logged to Langfuse ? 
- Ensure you're on the latest version of langfuse `uv add langfuse -U`. The latest version allows litellm to log JSON input/outputs to langfuse
- Follow [this checklist](https://langfuse.com/faq/all/missing-traces) if you don't see any traces in langfuse.

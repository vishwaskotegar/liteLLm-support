# Arize Phoenix

[Arize Phoenix](https://arize.com/phoenix/) is the open-source LLM tracing and evaluation project from [Arize AI](https://arize.com/?utm_source=litellm-docs&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=partner-docs&utm_content=phoenix-integration). Use it for local development, experimentation, and self-hosted workflows.

Phoenix is separate from [Arize AX](https://arize.com/products/ax/), the full-featured platform for production teams, AI-native companies, and enterprises, available as managed cloud or enterprise self-hosted deployment. LiteLLM supports both backends, but they use different callbacks, credentials, and endpoints. Use `arize_phoenix` for Phoenix, use `arize` for AX, or enable both when you need to send the same traces to each.

For teams building evaluation loops around LiteLLM traces, Arize's [agent evaluation guide](https://arize.com/guides/ai-agent-handbook/agent-evaluation/) and [LLM evaluation guide](https://arize.com/resources/llm-evaluation/) cover production workflows for tracing failures, evaluating model behavior, and improving agent reliability.

## Pre-Requisites

```shell
uv add litellm
```

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="SDK">

```python
import litellm
import os

os.environ["LITELLM_OTEL_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["PHOENIX_API_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "https://app.phoenix.arize.com/v1/traces"
os.environ["PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME"] = ""   # optional, defaults to "default"
# LLM API Keys
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""

# set arize_phoenix as a callback, litellm will send the data to phoenix
litellm.callbacks = ["arize_phoenix"]

# openai call
response = litellm.completion(
  model="{{openai_large}}",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi 👋 - i'm openai"}
  ]
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="proxy" label="LiteLLM Proxy">

1. Setup config.yaml

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: {{openai_large}}
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/{{openai_large}}
      api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY

litellm_settings:
  callbacks: ["arize_phoenix"]
```

2. Set your credentials

## What Phoenix renders

Open Phoenix; the project comes from `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME` (default `default`), stamped as the `openinference.project.name` resource attribute. Each request shows up as a `chat <model>` span under the request root. On the proxy you can send a team's or key's LLM spans to a different Phoenix project; see [Route traces to a Phoenix project per team or key](#route-traces-to-a-phoenix-project-per-team-or-key).

Phoenix uses the same OpenInference vocabulary as Arize AX, so the LLM-call span carries `llm.model_name`, `llm.provider`, the `llm.token_count.*` usage split, `llm.invocation_parameters`, the message arrays when content capture is on, and `llm.tools.*`, alongside the canonical `gen_ai.*` keys. See the [full attribute table](./opentelemetry_v2#seeing-your-traces).

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PHOENIX_API_KEY` | Phoenix Cloud only | Required when the endpoint is on `app.phoenix.arize.com`; litellm raises without it. Self-hosted Phoenix does not need one |
| `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_HTTP_ENDPOINT` | No | Collector endpoint; takes precedence over `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` when both are set |
| `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` | No | Collector endpoint, used when the HTTP variable is unset |
| `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME` | No | Defaults to `default`; also readable as `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_PROJECT_NAME`. This is the fallback project when a key or team does not set `phoenix_project_name` |

If neither endpoint variable is set, litellm falls back to `http://localhost:6006/v1/traces`.

### Protocol is inferred from the endpoint, not the variable name

Neither variable is tied to a protocol. litellm picks the protocol from the value you give it: an endpoint starting with `grpc://`, or containing `:4317` without a `/v1/traces` path, exports over gRPC, and anything else exports over HTTP. So a Phoenix Cloud URL works in either variable, and pointing `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` at `https://app.phoenix.arize.com/v1/traces` sends over HTTP as intended.

### Picking the right collector endpoint

Phoenix has more than one collector endpoint shape, and picking the wrong one is the most common Phoenix setup mistake. Point the endpoint at the shape that matches your deployment:

| Deployment | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Phoenix Cloud (Spaces) | `https://app.phoenix.arize.com/s/<space-name>/v1/traces` |
| Phoenix Cloud (legacy) | `https://app.phoenix.arize.com/legacy/v1/traces` |
| Phoenix Cloud (old) | `https://app.phoenix.arize.com/v1/traces` |
| Self-hosted | `http://localhost:6006/v1/traces` |

## Route traces to a Phoenix project per team or key

One Phoenix collector can hold many projects. On the LiteLLM proxy, set `phoenix_project_name` on a team or a virtual key so that team's (or that key's) LLM spans land in their own Phoenix project. Keys with no project name keep using `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME`.

This is how you split traces by team without standing up a Phoenix instance per tenant. The project comes only from the team or key the proxy resolved at auth. A caller who puts `phoenix_project_name` in the request body is ignored; the call still returns 200 and no attacker-chosen project is created.

Requires OTel v2 (`LITELLM_OTEL_V2=true`) and `callbacks: ["arize_phoenix"]`. Phoenix 15.5.0+ honors the `x-project-name` header this uses; older collectors ignore it and stay on the env project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="team" label="Per team">

Every key on the team sends its LLM spans to the named project.

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/team/new' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"team_alias": "payments", "metadata": {"phoenix_project_name": "payments-prod"}}'
```

Update an existing team the same way:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/team/update' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"team_id": "<team-id>", "metadata": {"phoenix_project_name": "payments-prod"}}'
```

Then generate a key for that team and call the proxy as usual:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/key/generate' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"team_id": "<team-id>"}'
```

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $TEAM_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "{{openai_large}}", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}]}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="key" label="Per key">

A single key can name its own project, including keys that do not belong to a team.

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/key/generate' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"metadata": {"phoenix_project_name": "payments-canary"}}'
```

Existing keys take the same field on `/key/update`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can set the same `metadata.phoenix_project_name` field on the team or key in the Admin UI.

After the chat (or `/v1/messages`, `/v1/responses`) call, Phoenix shows a project named `payments-prod` containing that request's `chat <model>` span. A second team with `phoenix_project_name: "search-prod"` lands in a different project on the same collector.

### Which project wins

Highest priority first:

1. `phoenix_project_name_override` on the key or team
2. `phoenix_project_name` on the key or team
3. `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME` (or `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_PROJECT_NAME`), else `default`

If the same field is set on both the key and the team, the team's value is used. `phoenix_project_name_override` is the escape hatch when a key should leave its team's project.

### What is and is not routed

The LLM-call span (`chat <model>`) is the span Phoenix uses to create and fill the named project. The request's HTTP root, auth, and database spans stay in the env-configured default project.

Phoenix assigns a whole trace to one project by whichever of its spans arrives first. The routed LLM span therefore starts its own trace, with a link back to the request trace so you can still jump between them.

A gRPC-only Phoenix exporter cannot route: `x-project-name` is honored on OTLP/HTTP only. Point `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_HTTP_ENDPOINT` at an HTTP `/v1/traces` URL (see [Picking the right collector endpoint](#picking-the-right-collector-endpoint)). Guardrail spans are not project-routed.

This is different from [per-team credentials](./opentelemetry_v2#per-key--per-team-credentials-multi-tenant), which send a tenant's traces to its own backend account. Project routing stays on the one Phoenix collector and only changes the project name.

## Advanced

### Send to Phoenix and Arize AX at once

Presets compose, so you can run both backends from one proxy:

```yaml
litellm_settings:
  callbacks: ["arize_phoenix", "arize"]
```

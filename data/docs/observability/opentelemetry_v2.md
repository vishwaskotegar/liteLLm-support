# OpenTelemetry v2

OpenTelemetry v2 (OTel v2) is LiteLLM Proxy's next-generation tracing. It gives you **one clean trace per request** covering the incoming HTTP call, authentication, guardrails, the LLM call itself, and the internal database/cache work, all nested in a single tree.

It follows standard [OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/), so the traces it produces are readable in any OTel backend (Grafana Tempo, Jaeger, Honeycomb, Datadog, …) and come with ready-made presets for popular LLM observability tools (Arize, Phoenix, Langfuse, Weave, Langtrace, Levo, AgentOps).

:::info[Opt-in feature]

OTel v2 is **off by default**. Nothing in it runs until you set `LITELLM_OTEL_V2=true`. It is separate from the existing [OpenTelemetry integration](./opentelemetry_integration), so pick one. If you are moving from v1, see [Migrating to OpenTelemetry v2](./opentelemetry_v2_migration).

:::

## What you get

A single request to your proxy produces **one trace** that looks like this:

```
POST /v1/chat/completions                  ← HTTP request (server span)
├── auth /v1/chat/completions              ← authentication
│   ├── postgres get_key_object            ← DB lookups during auth
│   └── postgres get_team_membership
├── execute_guardrail presidio-pii         ← each guardrail that runs
├── chat {{openai_large}}                     ← the LLM call (model, tokens, cost)
└── batch_write_to_db                      ← spend/usage written to DB
```

Highlights:

- **One trace, end to end** — the HTTP request, auth, guardrails, the LLM call, and DB writes all live in the same trace, correctly nested.
- **Rich GenAI attributes** — every LLM-call span carries `gen_ai.*` attributes: model, provider, token usage, cost, finish reasons, request parameters, and more.
- **Standards-based** — built on the official OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions, so it works with any OTel-compatible backend.
- **Vendor presets** — one line to ship traces to Arize, Phoenix, Langfuse, Weave, Langtrace, Levo, or AgentOps in the format each tool expects.
- **Safe by default** — prompts and responses are **not** captured unless you explicitly opt in. Noisy routes (health checks, metrics scrapes, UI assets) are excluded automatically.
- **Distributed tracing** — if your client sends a `traceparent` header, LiteLLM's spans nest inside your existing trace.

## Getting started

Set `LITELLM_OTEL_V2=true` in the proxy environment, then pick a destination below.

### 1. Send traces to any OTLP collector

This path sends spans over OTLP (the OpenTelemetry Protocol) to a collector or backend you are already running at the endpoint below; if you do not have one yet, stay on the console exporter from the Quickstart until you do. Set the feature flag plus the standard `OTEL_*` environment variables in the proxy's environment. No config change is needed.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="otlp-http" label="OTLP HTTP collector">

```shell
LITELLM_OTEL_V2=true
OTEL_EXPORTER="otlp_http"
OTEL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="otlp-grpc" label="OTLP gRPC collector">

```shell
LITELLM_OTEL_V2=true
OTEL_EXPORTER="otlp_grpc"
OTEL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317"
```

> gRPC export needs `grpcio`. Install with `pip install grpcio`.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Pass auth headers your backend needs via `OTEL_HEADERS`:

```shell
OTEL_HEADERS="api-key=your-key,x-tenant=acme"
```

Then start the proxy as usual:

```shell
litellm --config config.yaml
```

Make a request, and you'll see one trace per request in your backend.

### 2. Send traces to a specific tool (presets)

For LLM observability tools, use a **preset**. A preset knows the tool's endpoint and emits attributes in the schema that tool expects. To enable one, add its name to `callbacks` in your config and set the tool's credentials as env vars.

<TabItem value="langtrace" label="Langtrace">

Langtrace does not accept litellm's OTLP spans directly. It ingests JSON-encoded OTLP at a custom path (`/api/trace`) with an `x-api-key` header, whereas litellm v2 sends protobuf to `/v1/traces`. Run an OpenTelemetry Collector between them: litellm exports to the collector, and the collector re-encodes the spans to JSON and forwards them to Langtrace. The `langtrace` callback still applies Langtrace's attribute schema; the collector only handles delivery.

```yaml title="config.yaml"

```shell
LITELLM_OTEL_V2=true

:::tip[Send to several backends at once]

To send the same traces to multiple vendors, list each preset in `callbacks` and set each one's env vars. For example, Langfuse and Arize together:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
litellm_settings:
  callbacks: ["langfuse_otel", "arize"]
```

Each preset adds its own destination, so your spans reach all of them in parallel, each in that tool's native format.

:::

### Preset reference

Every preset turns into one exporter on a single shared tracer. The table lists, for each one, the callback name you put in `callbacks`, the credentials it reads, where it sends, the attribute vocabulary it adds on top of the canonical `gen_ai.*` keys, and whether it supports per-request (per-team/key) credentials.

| Preset | Callback | Required env vars | Optional env vars | Destination | Vocabulary | Per-request creds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Arize AX | `arize` | `ARIZE_SPACE_ID` (`ARIZE_SPACE_KEY` deprecated), `ARIZE_API_KEY` | `ARIZE_PROJECT_NAME` (names the project traces land in), `ARIZE_ENDPOINT` (gRPC, default `https://otlp.arize.com/v1`), `ARIZE_HTTP_ENDPOINT` (HTTP) | Arize AX platform | OpenInference | Yes |
| Arize Phoenix | `arize_phoenix` | `PHOENIX_API_KEY` (Phoenix Cloud only; self-hosted needs none) | `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_HTTP_ENDPOINT` or `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` (protocol inferred from the value), `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME` | Phoenix (self-hosted or Phoenix Cloud) | OpenInference | No |
| Langfuse | `langfuse_otel` | `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | `LANGFUSE_HOST` (or `LANGFUSE_OTEL_HOST`; default `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`, EU is `https://cloud.langfuse.com`), `OTEL_IGNORE_CONTEXT_PROPAGATION` (set `true` to drop inbound `traceparent`) | Langfuse Cloud or self-hosted | Langfuse | Yes |
| Weave (W&B) | `weave_otel` | `WANDB_API_KEY`, `WANDB_PROJECT_ID` (`<entity>/<project>`) | `WANDB_HOST` (default `https://trace.wandb.ai`) | Weights & Biases Weave | OpenInference + Weave | Yes |
| Langtrace | `langtrace` | none of its own | — | Langtrace, via an OpenTelemetry Collector (Langtrace ingests JSON-only OTLP) | Langtrace | No |
| Levo | `levo` | `LEVOAI_API_KEY`, `LEVOAI_ORG_ID`, `LEVOAI_WORKSPACE_ID`, `LEVOAI_COLLECTOR_URL` | — | Levo collector | canonical `gen_ai.*` only | No |
| AgentOps | `agentops` | `AGENTOPS_API_KEY` | `AGENTOPS_SERVICE_NAME` (default `agentops`), `AGENTOPS_ENVIRONMENT` (no default) | AgentOps (`https://otlp.agentops.ai/v1/traces`) | canonical `gen_ai.*` only | No |

Notes:

- **Arize AX vs Arize Phoenix**: use `arize` for the full-featured AX platform and `arize_phoenix` for Phoenix local or self-hosted workflows. They use different credentials and endpoints, so pick the callback for the backend you actually run. For product-specific setup, see the dedicated [Arize AX](./arize_integration) and [Arize Phoenix](./phoenix_integration) guides.
- **Langtrace** ingests JSON-only OTLP at a custom path, so litellm v2 (which sends protobuf to `/v1/traces`) cannot export to it directly. Route through an OpenTelemetry Collector that re-encodes to JSON; the `langtrace` preset only adds the Langtrace attribute schema to your spans. See the Langtrace tab above for the collector config.
- Vocabulary is additive: every preset's spans always carry the canonical OpenTelemetry `gen_ai.*` attributes; the listed vocabulary is layered on top so the destination tool reads its native schema.

## Seeing your traces

Once a backend is configured with its preset, each request shows up in that tool's UI as a `chat <model>` span under the request root. Each tab below covers the vendor-specific gotchas (project mapping, endpoint variants, metadata keys) that trip people up.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="arize-shot" label="Arize">

#### What Arize renders

Open your Arize project; the trace appears under the project named by `ARIZE_PROJECT_NAME`. The `openinference` mapper stamps the OpenInference vocabulary onto the LLM-call span alongside the canonical `gen_ai.*` keys, so Arize reads its native schema without dropping the canonical ones.

#### Attributes added by the `openinference` mapper

| Attribute | Restates |
|---|---|
| `openinference.span.kind` | Fixed `LLM` |
| `llm.model_name`, `llm.provider` | model, provider |
| `llm.token_count.prompt`, `completion`, `total` | usage split |
| `llm.invocation_parameters` | JSON blob of request params |
| `llm.input_messages.{idx}.message.role`, `content` | prompt (content capture on), [capped](#chat-messages-are-capped) |
| `llm.output_messages.{idx}.message.role`, `content` | response (content capture on), [capped](#chat-messages-are-capped) |
| `input.value`, `output.value` | JSON arrays of every message's role and text (content capture on) |
| `llm.tools.{idx}.tool.name`, `description`, `json_schema` | tool definitions, [capped](#tool-definitions-are-capped) |

See the full [OpenInference spec](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/blob/main/spec/semantic_conventions.md) for the definitive vocabulary.

#### Setup notes

- `ARIZE_SPACE_KEY` is the deprecated name for `ARIZE_SPACE_ID`; the preset still reads it for backward compatibility, but prefer `ARIZE_SPACE_ID` in new configs.

![LiteLLM trace in Arize](/img/observability/otel_v2_arize.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="phoenix-shot" label="Arize Phoenix">

#### What Phoenix renders

Open Phoenix; the project comes from `PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME` (default `default`), stamped as the `openinference.project.name` resource attribute. Phoenix uses the same OpenInference vocabulary as Arize AX.

On the proxy you can send a team's or key's LLM spans to a different Phoenix project on the same collector. Set `phoenix_project_name` on the team or key; see [Route traces to a Phoenix project per team or key](./phoenix_integration#route-traces-to-a-phoenix-project-per-team-or-key).

#### Attributes added by the `openinference` mapper

Same as the Arize tab above.

#### Setup notes

Phoenix has more than one collector endpoint shape, and picking the wrong one is the most common Phoenix setup mistake. Point `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_HTTP_ENDPOINT` (or `PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT`, which takes over when the first is unset) at the shape that matches your deployment. Neither variable is tied to a protocol: litellm infers it from the value, exporting over gRPC only for a `grpc://` endpoint or a `:4317` one without a `/v1/traces` path, and over HTTP otherwise.

| Deployment | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Phoenix Cloud (Spaces) | `https://app.phoenix.arize.com/s/<space-name>/v1/traces` |
| Phoenix Cloud (legacy) | `https://app.phoenix.arize.com/legacy/v1/traces` |
| Phoenix Cloud (old) | `https://app.phoenix.arize.com/v1/traces` |
| Self-hosted | `http://localhost:6006/v1/traces` |

![LiteLLM trace in Phoenix](/img/observability/otel_v2_phoenix.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="langfuse-shot" label="Langfuse">

#### What Langfuse renders

Open the Langfuse traces view; the LLM-call span appears as a Langfuse **generation**, filterable by team. Endpoint resolution is `LANGFUSE_OTEL_HOST`, then `LANGFUSE_HOST`, then the US cloud default, with `/api/public/otel` appended for a self-hosted host.

#### Attributes added by the `langfuse` mapper

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `langfuse.observation.type` | Fixed `generation` so this span appears as a model call |
| `langfuse.observation.model.name` | Model shown on the generation |
| `langfuse.observation.model.parameters` | JSON of request params (temperature, top_p, max_tokens, penalties, seed) |
| `langfuse.observation.id` | Same as `litellm.call_id` |
| `langfuse.observation.input` / `output` | Prompt and response bodies (content capture on) |
| `langfuse.observation.usage_details` | Input/output/total token counts |
| `langfuse.observation.cost_details` | Total cost |
| `langfuse.trace.metadata.team_id`, `team_alias` | Filterable team identity |

These are set by the preset from the request and response, not from a client-supplied metadata dict, so you get them without extra config.

#### Setup notes

- Auth is HTTP Basic, `Authorization: Basic <base64(public_key:secret_key)>`; the preset builds this from `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` so you never set the header directly.
- If your client already sends a W3C `traceparent` and Langfuse is picking up the wrong parent, set `OTEL_IGNORE_CONTEXT_PROPAGATION=true` in the proxy environment to drop inbound context.
- By default your Langfuse project receives the whole request tree. Set `LITELLM_OTEL_LANGFUSE_SPAN_SCOPE=llm_only` to keep just the generations; see [Send only the model calls to Langfuse](#send-only-the-model-calls-to-langfuse).
- This is a Langfuse-flavored path; for a general-purpose OTel backend, use the [generic OTLP setup](#1-send-traces-to-any-otlp-collector) instead.

![LiteLLM trace in Langfuse](/img/observability/otel_v2_langfuse.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="weave-shot" label="Weave (W&B)">

#### What Weave renders

Open the Weave project at `wandb.ai/<entity>/weave`. Weave consumes OpenInference plus a small Weave overlay, so the `weave_otel` preset composes both mappers on the same span.

#### Attributes added by the `weave` mapper

The `openinference` mapper (see the Arize tab) runs first, then the `weave` mapper adds:

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `weave.display_name` | `"{operation} {model}"` (e.g. `chat gpt-4o`) |
| `weave.call_id` | Same as `litellm.call_id` |
| `weave.output` | JSON array of choices (content capture on) |

#### Setup notes

- `WANDB_PROJECT_ID` must be in `entity/project` form, which is the most common setup mistake.
- The `weave_otel` preset is the OTel-based Weave integration and is unrelated to the older `wandb` success-callback logger (which uses the `wandb` Python package and writes to W&B directly, not through OTel); see the [W&B legacy page](./wandb_integration) if you're looking for that one.

![LiteLLM trace in Weave](/img/observability/otel_v2_weave.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="agentops-shot" label="AgentOps">

#### What AgentOps renders

Open the AgentOps dashboard. AgentOps does not add a vendor mapper, so spans arrive in the canonical `gen_ai.*` schema (plus `legacy` if enabled).

#### Attributes added by the AgentOps preset

No vendor mapper is added, so the LLM-call span carries only the canonical keys listed in [Span attributes](#span-attributes). The preset controls two resource-level labels on the traces:

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `service.name` | From `AGENTOPS_SERVICE_NAME` (default `agentops`) |
| `deployment.environment` | From `AGENTOPS_ENVIRONMENT`; only stamped when set |

#### Setup notes

- AgentOps mints its auth token on the first span export rather than at startup, so the very first export can look briefly delayed; this happens once per process and is expected.
- Set `AGENTOPS_SERVICE_NAME` / `AGENTOPS_ENVIRONMENT` if you want to separate environments in the AgentOps UI.

![LiteLLM trace in AgentOps](/img/observability/otel_v2_agentops.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="langtrace-shot" label="Langtrace">

#### What Langtrace renders

Open the Langtrace UI; the spans flow through your OpenTelemetry Collector carrying the `langtrace.*` and `llm.*` keys.

#### Attributes added by the `langtrace` mapper

| Attribute | Restates |
|---|---|
| `langtrace.service.name` | provider |
| `llm.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, `gen_ai.response_id`, `gen_ai.system_fingerprint` | request/response identifiers |
| `llm.temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `max_tokens`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty` | request params |
| `llm.stream` | streaming flag |
| `llm.token.counts.prompt`, `completion`, `total` | usage split |
| `llm.prompts`, `llm.completions` | JSON arrays (content capture on) |

#### Setup notes

Langtrace ingests JSON-only OTLP at a custom path, so litellm exports through an OpenTelemetry Collector that re-encodes to JSON. See the [Langtrace tab under Getting started](#2-send-traces-to-a-specific-tool-presets) for the collector configuration.

![LiteLLM trace in Langtrace](/img/observability/otel_v2_langtrace.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="levo-shot" label="Levo">

#### What Levo renders

Open the Levo dashboard. Levo does not add a vendor mapper, so spans arrive in the canonical `gen_ai.*` schema (plus `legacy` if enabled).

#### Attributes added by the Levo preset

No vendor mapper is added. Traces carry only the canonical keys from [Span attributes](#span-attributes). The preset routes spans to `LEVOAI_COLLECTOR_URL` with `Authorization: Bearer $LEVOAI_API_KEY`, plus `x-levo-organization-id` and `x-levo-workspace-id` headers built from `LEVOAI_ORG_ID` and `LEVOAI_WORKSPACE_ID`.

#### Setup notes

- The collector URL is used as-is, no path manipulation, so provide the exact URL Levo gave you.
- To label spans with an environment, set `OTEL_ENVIRONMENT_NAME`; the Levo preset reads no environment variable of its own beyond the four required ones.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="generic-shot" label="Generic OTLP">

#### What a generic OTLP backend renders

Whatever your backend's UI shows for standard OTel GenAI spans. The `generic` preset (and the plain env-var OTLP path from [Getting started section 1](#1-send-traces-to-any-otlp-collector)) does not add a vendor mapper.

#### Attributes added

None beyond the canonical `gen_ai.*` and `litellm.*` keys listed in [Span attributes](#span-attributes), plus the `legacy` Traceloop keys if `LITELLM_OTEL_LEGACY_COMPAT=true`.

#### Setup notes

Use this path for Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb, Datadog, SigNoz, Splunk Observability Cloud, and any other backend that consumes standard OTLP. If a backend is not listed above and there is no dedicated tab, this is the one to use. For Grafana Cloud specifically, see [Grafana Cloud](./grafana_cloud), which covers the OTLP gateway's auth format and the prebuilt GenAI dashboards.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Capturing prompts & responses

By default, OTel v2 records **metadata only** (model, tokens, cost, timing) and **never** writes prompt or response text to your traces. This is intentional, and it keeps sensitive content out of your observability backend.

To capture message content, opt in explicitly:

```shell
# no_content (default) — never capture prompts/responses
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT="no_content"

# span_only — write prompts/responses as attributes on spans
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT="span_only"

# event_only — write prompts/responses on log events instead of span attributes
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT="event_only"

# span_and_event — write content to both spans and events
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT="span_and_event"
```

The gate is enforced centrally, so it applies to **every** backend at once. A user request can never force its prompt into your backend while capture is disabled.

## Span attributes

Attributes come from a chain of mappers stamped onto each span in order. The canonical `genai` mapper is always applied first, the `legacy` compatibility mapper is on by default, and each preset adds one vendor mapper on top. Later mappers can override earlier ones; the same span therefore carries several vocabularies describing the same call.

The first two tables cover the LLM-call span in the canonical vocabulary. Sections below list the other span kinds, then what each vendor mapper adds.

### LLM-call span, canonical `gen_ai.*` + `litellm.*`

Request-side keys:

| Attribute | When set |
|---|---|
| `gen_ai.operation.name` | always (`chat`, `text_completion`, `embeddings`) |
| `gen_ai.provider.name` | always |
| `gen_ai.request.model` | always (the user-facing model group name) |
| `gen_ai.request.temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `max_tokens` | when set on the request |
| `gen_ai.request.frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `seed` | when set |
| `gen_ai.request.stop_sequences` | when set (string array) |
| `gen_ai.tool.{idx}.name`, `description`, `parameters` | one set per tool definition, for the leading tools only ([why](#tool-definitions-are-capped)) |
| `litellm.request.tools.declared` | when the request declares tools; the full count, capped or not |
| `server.address`, `server.port` | when the provider endpoint is known |

#### Tool definitions are capped

Only the leading declared tools get `gen_ai.tool.{idx}.*` attributes. Tool definitions are an unbounded attribute family, one entry per tool per field per active vocabulary, and OpenTelemetry caps a span at 128 attributes by default. An agent that declares a hundred or more tools would otherwise blow past that ceiling, and because the limit evicts the oldest attributes first, the `gen_ai.*` attributes above would be the ones discarded, leaving a span carrying nothing but tool schemas. The cap keeps model, token usage, and cost on the span no matter how many tools a request declares.

The ceiling is span-wide, not per vocabulary. Tool definitions may claim a quarter of the span's attribute budget in total, and that allowance is split across the vocabularies that emit them, so the number of tools detailed depends on how many are active: 5 tools each under the default `genai` plus `legacy` pair, 3 tools each once a vendor vocabulary such as `openinference` is layered on. Splitting it this way is what stops three vocabularies spelling the same tools out from summing back past the limit.

`litellm.request.tools.declared` always carries the true total, so you can tell when the per-tool detail was truncated. Requests declaring fewer tools than the allowance keep full detail.

#### Chat messages are capped

The `openinference` mapper's `llm.input_messages.{idx}.*` and `llm.output_messages.{idx}.*` keys are the other unbounded family: two attributes per message, prompt and response alike. Past a few dozen turns they alone would exceed the 128-attribute default and evict the `gen_ai.*` model, usage, cost, and finish-reason attributes written before them. They are therefore fitted to the budget the span has left: its tracer provider's attribute count limit (`OTEL_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT_LIMIT`, or the `SpanLimits` of an injected or per-request routed provider) minus every other attribute on the span, `error.*` included. A conversation that fits is indexed in full. One that does not loses whole messages, role and content together, least valuable first: middle prompt turns, then extra response choices, then message 0 and the newest turn, and last the first choice. Surviving messages keep their original indices, so message 0 and the newest turns stay addressable even when `OTEL_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT` clips the `input.value` blob before the end of the conversation. With `genai` plus `openinference` and `LITELLM_OTEL_LEGACY_COMPAT=false`, a 60-turn conversation with one reply at the default limit indexes `llm.input_messages.0`, `.18` through `.59`, and `llm.output_messages.0`; the default `legacy` mapper adds keys of its own, so fewer middle turns survive with it on.

The cap only touches the per-index convenience keys. `input.value` and `output.value` still list every message's role and text, and the canonical `gen_ai.input.messages` and `gen_ai.output.messages` blobs carry the full message objects (tool calls and non-text parts included), so the whole conversation stays on the span and Arize keeps rendering it. Those blobs are single strings, so `OTEL_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT` (unlimited by default) can truncate them on a long conversation; the surviving per-index keys then still show the opener and the newest turns. Phoenix compacts the per-index keys into a dense list when it renders a span, so a gap in indices shows up there as a shorter message list, in the same order.

Response, usage, cost, identity:

| Attribute | When set |
|---|---|
| `gen_ai.response.id`, `gen_ai.response.model` | on success |
| `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons` | on success (string array) |
| `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | on success |
| `gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages` | content capture on |
| `gen_ai.system_instructions` | content capture on, when a system prompt is present |
| `litellm.call_id` | always |
| `litellm.provider.model` | always (the model string actually sent to the provider) |
| `litellm.request.streaming` | when true |
| `litellm.request.route` | on the proxy (the same route the root span reports as `http.route`: the FastAPI route template, e.g. `/v1/responses/{response_id}`, or the literal path on a passthrough prefix such as `/openai/...`; when no server span exists, for example the route is in `OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS` or the FastAPI instrumentation is not installed, it falls back to the route the proxy recorded at auth) |
| `litellm.cost.total` | on success |
| `litellm.cost.input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_creation`, `tool_usage` | when the source reported the breakdown |
| `litellm.cost.original`, `discount_amount`, `discount_percent`, `margin_fixed_amount`, `margin_percent`, `margin_total_amount` | when reported |

Status and errors:

- **On failure:** the span records the standard `exception` event (`exception.type`, `exception.message`), sets `error.type` from the exception class, and sets its status to `ERROR`.
- **On success:** the status is left `UNSET` (the semconv default, matching the FastAPI server span). Only a genuine error sets `ERROR`, so do not key an alert on a status of `OK`.

### Other span kinds

**Guardrail span**, which uses the `litellm.guardrail.*` namespace: `name`, `mode`, `status`, `provider`, `action`, `response`, `violation_categories`, `confidence_score`, `risk_score`, `masked_entity_count`, `duration`, `id`, `policy_template`, `detection_method`. `status` is one of `success`, `guardrail_intervened`, `guardrail_failed_to_respond`, or `not_run`; a blocking `guardrail_intervened` or `guardrail_failed_to_respond` also sets span status to `ERROR`.

**Datastore span** (redis, postgres): `db.system.name`, `db.operation.name`, `litellm.service.name`, `litellm.service.call_type`.

**Internal service span**: the `litellm.service.*` keys only (no `db.*`).

**MCP tool-call span**: `gen_ai.operation.name=execute_tool`, `mcp.method.name`, `mcp.session.id`, `gen_ai.tool.name`, `litellm.mcp.server.name`, `litellm.call_id`, `litellm.cost.total`. `gen_ai.tool.call.arguments` and `gen_ai.tool.call.result` are gated by the same content-capture setting as prompt content.

**Root HTTP server span**: the HTTP semconv keys `http.request.method`, `http.route`, `http.response.status_code`, `url.path`, stamped by the FastAPI instrumentation (not by any of LiteLLM's mappers).

Each vendor preset also composes one vendor-specific mapper on top of these canonical keys, so the destination reads the trace in its native schema. Those per-vendor tables live under the matching [Seeing your traces](#seeing-your-traces) tab.

## Attribute conventions

LiteLLM emits one canonical set of GenAI attributes and layers other vocabularies on top by adding a mapper; the active set is controlled by `mapper_names`, with `genai` always first. The `legacy` mapper is on by default (`LITELLM_OTEL_LEGACY_COMPAT=true`) and re-emits the same data under the older semconv-ai / Traceloop names, so dashboards built against those keep working through a migration. Turn it off with `LITELLM_OTEL_LEGACY_COMPAT=false` once your queries use the canonical keys. Vendor mappers (`openinference`, `langfuse`, `weave`, `langtrace`) are added by their presets and never replace the canonical keys.

The most common keys line up across vocabularies as follows:

| Canonical (`genai`) | Legacy (Traceloop) | OpenInference |
|---|---|---|
| `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` | `gen_ai.usage.prompt_tokens` | `llm.token_count.prompt` |
| `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | `gen_ai.usage.completion_tokens` | `llm.token_count.completion` |
| `gen_ai.provider.name` | `gen_ai.system` | `llm.provider` |
| `litellm.request.streaming` | `llm.is_streaming` | n/a |
| `gen_ai.request.model` | n/a | `llm.model_name` |

## Request identity on every span

LiteLLM writes a small allowlist of request-identity values into standard OpenTelemetry [Baggage](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/baggage/) at the auth boundary. A custom span processor then copies those values onto every span in the trace, so a guardrail, datastore, or service span is filterable by team or key without LiteLLM re-stamping each one by hand.

By default the following keys are written onto every span:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `litellm.team.id` | Team UUID |
| `litellm.team.alias` | Team display name |
| `litellm.team.metadata` | Team's free-form metadata, filtered to the sub-keys you allowlist |
| `litellm.api_key.hash` | Hash of the caller's virtual key |
| `gen_ai.request.model` | User-facing model group name |
| `litellm.provider.model` | Dispatched model on the provider |

A separate set of request-metadata fields is written under the `litellm.metadata.*` namespace. Defaults:

`litellm.metadata.user_api_key_org_id`, `litellm.metadata.user_api_key_user_id`, `litellm.metadata.user_api_key_alias`, `litellm.metadata.user_api_key_end_user_id`, `litellm.metadata.requester_ip_address`.

Two defaults stay conservative for privacy. The end-user id is promotable but off by default at the top level (it identifies an individual); it appears under `litellm.metadata.user_api_key_end_user_id`, which callers who filter by user should enable. A team's free-form metadata is never emitted whole; only the sub-keys you allowlist leave the process, and the allowlist is empty by default.

Override any of these with the `LITELLM_OTEL_BAGGAGE_PROMOTED_KEYS`, `LITELLM_OTEL_BAGGAGE_METADATA_KEYS`, and `LITELLM_OTEL_BAGGAGE_TEAM_METADATA_KEYS` env vars (comma-separated), or the matching YAML lists under `callback_settings.otel`.

## Metrics

Alongside traces, OTel v2 can emit GenAI **client metrics**: histograms for call latency, token usage, and cost that your backend aggregates across requests. Like the rest of OTel v2 they stay off until you turn them on.

Set the flag in the proxy environment next to `LITELLM_OTEL_V2`:

```shell
LITELLM_OTEL_V2=true
LITELLM_OTEL_INTEGRATION_ENABLE_METRICS=true
```

Metrics ship through the exporter you already configured for traces. `OTEL_EXPORTER` (`console`, `otlp_http`, `otlp_grpc`), `OTEL_ENDPOINT`, and `OTEL_HEADERS` decide where the metric stream goes exactly as they do for spans, so the collector that receives your traces receives the metrics too.

### What's recorded

Each successful LLM call records the standard OpenTelemetry GenAI client metrics:

| Metric | Unit | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| `gen_ai.client.operation.duration` | `s` | Wall-clock time for the whole LLM call |
| `gen_ai.client.token.usage` | `{token}` | Tokens consumed, split into input and output by the `gen_ai.token.type` attribute |
| `gen_ai.usage.cost` | `USD` | LiteLLM's computed cost for the call |
| `gen_ai.server.time_to_first_token` | `s` | Time to the first streamed token (streaming calls) |
| `gen_ai.server.time_per_output_token` | `s` | Average time per output token |
| `gen_ai.client.response.duration` | `s` | Provider-side generation time |

:::note[Renamed in this release]

`gen_ai.usage.cost`, `gen_ai.server.time_to_first_token`, and `gen_ai.server.time_per_output_token` were previously emitted as `gen_ai.client.token.cost`, `gen_ai.client.response.time_to_first_token`, and `gen_ai.client.response.time_per_output_token`. The older spellings are not GenAI semantic conventions and no vendor dashboard queries them, so nothing prebuilt could chart LiteLLM's cost or latency. If you hand-built panels or alerts against the old names, repoint them at the names above

:::

Every sample carries the same identity attributes as the matching span (operation, provider/system, request model, framework, and selected `metadata.*` fields), so you can group the histograms by model, provider, key, or team. These are the same six metrics the [v1 OpenTelemetry integration](./opentelemetry_integration) emits, with identical names and units, so a dashboard built for one reads the other.

### Control metric attribute cardinality

By default every metric sample is stamped with the full identity attribute set, which includes per-request fields such as `hidden_params` and several `metadata.*` values. Those are close to unique per request, so each one multiplies the number of time series your backend tracks (one series per distinct attribute combination). At volume this explodes metric cardinality, and some backends, for example Splunk Observability Cloud, start throttling or dropping the metrics.

v2 reads the same filter v1 does, from `callback_settings.otel.attributes` in your config. Nest an `attributes` block there with either an `include_list` (allowlist; emit only the listed attributes) or an `exclude_list` (denylist; emit everything except the listed attributes). The two are mutually exclusive. The filter applies to metrics only; spans keep their full attribute set, so traces stay rich while metric cardinality stays bounded.

The block sits under `callback_settings.otel`. With `LITELLM_OTEL_V2` set, listing `otel` in `callbacks` builds the v2 logger and reads this block (it builds the legacy v1 logger only when the flag is off); the block is also read on the default path when no `otel` callback is listed.

Unlike v1, v2 has no per-instance `attributes` field, so this global block is the only source. v2 also resolves the filter lazily on the first metric a request records rather than at boot, so a bad config (both lists set, or a forbidden name) surfaces on that first recorded request and editing the lists takes effect only after a restart. The filter is read only on the default OTLP path (callback name `otel` or unset); preset destinations such as `arize`, `arize_phoenix`, and `langfuse_otel` emit their metrics with the full attribute set, the same as in v1.

```yaml title="config.yaml"
callback_settings:
  otel:
    attributes:
      exclude_list:
        - hidden_params
        - metadata.requester_metadata
        - metadata.requester_ip_address
        - metadata.spend_logs_metadata
        - metadata.mcp_tool_call_metadata
        - metadata.vector_store_request_metadata
        - metadata.prompt_management_metadata
```

When you want the smallest, most predictable attribute set, list exactly the attributes to keep with `include_list`. Anything not listed is dropped from metrics:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
callback_settings:
  otel:
    attributes:
      include_list:
        - gen_ai.operation.name
        - gen_ai.system
        - gen_ai.request.model
        - gen_ai.framework
        - metadata.user_api_key_team_id
        - metadata.user_api_key_org_id
```

`gen_ai.token.type` is never filtered out. It is stamped on `gen_ai.client.token.usage` after the filter runs, so the input/output split survives whatever list you set, and naming it in either `include_list` or `exclude_list` is rejected.

## Which routes are traced

High-frequency, non-LLM routes are **excluded by default** so they don't flood your traces: health checks (`/health*`), the Prometheus scrape (`/metrics`), and static UI/docs assets (`/ui`, `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/_next`, `/openapi.json`, favicons, …).

To change the set, use the standard OpenTelemetry env var (comma-separated paths, substring-matched):

```shell
# Trace everything, including health checks
OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS=""

# Exclude only your own custom paths
OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS="/health,/internal"
```

## Per-key / per-team credentials (multi-tenant)

One proxy can serve many tenants: a team or a virtual key carries its own backend credentials, so its traces land in that tenant's own Langfuse project, Arize space, Weave project, or New Relic account instead of the proxy-wide one. The credentials come from the key and the team the proxy resolved at auth, never from the request body, so a caller cannot pick another tenant's backend.

This is the same key/team callback mechanism described in [Team/Key based logging](../proxy/team_logging); v2 applies it to the OTel presets. There is no separate admin-owned "destination" object, and `/credentials` holds LLM provider credentials, not logging ones.

### Which presets support per-request credentials

| Preset | Callback | Fields on the key or team | What varies per tenant |
|---|---|---|---|
| Langfuse | `langfuse_otel` | `langfuse_public_key`, `langfuse_secret_key`, `langfuse_host` | The Langfuse project traces land in, and the server they are sent to |
| Arize AX | `arize` | `arize_space_id` (or the deprecated `arize_space_key`), `arize_api_key` | The Arize space |
| Weave (W&B) | `weave_otel` | `wandb_api_key`, `weave_project_id` | The W&B account and Weave project |
| New Relic | `newrelic` | `newrelic_api_key`, `newrelic_region` (`us` or `eu`, default `us`) | The New Relic account and its data center |

Every other preset (`arize_phoenix`, `langtrace`, `levo`, `agentops`) and the plain `otel` OTLP exporter has no per-request credentials, so those always export with the proxy-wide configuration. For Phoenix, split tenants by project instead of by backend, with [`phoenix_project_name` on the team or key](./phoenix_integration#route-traces-to-a-phoenix-project-per-team-or-key). To keep one backend but label a tenant's spans with its own `service.name`, set `otel_service_name` in the key's or team's `metadata` instead.

### Set it on a team

Register the callback on the team; every key on that team then exports with these credentials:

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/team/<team-id>/callback' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "callback_name": "langfuse_otel",
    "callback_type": "success",
    "callback_vars": {
      "langfuse_public_key": "pk-lf-...",
      "langfuse_secret_key": "sk-lf-..."
    }
  }'
```

`GET /team/<team-id>/callback` reads back what a team has registered, `DELETE /team/<team-id>/callback/<callback_name>` removes one integration, and `POST /team/<team-id>/disable_logging` removes all of them.

### Set it on a key

A key can carry its own credentials in `metadata.logging`, including a key with no team:

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/key/generate' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "metadata": {
      "logging": [{
        "callback_name": "arize",
        "callback_type": "success",
        "callback_vars": {"arize_space_id": "...", "arize_api_key": "..."}
      }]
    }
  }'
```

Existing keys take the same field on `/key/update`. You can also fill both of these in from the Admin UI, on the team's or the key's logging settings.

### What the tenant receives

A key or team that names its own backend gets the **whole trace** under one root: the HTTP request, the auth step, the model call with its tokens and cost, and the spend write. Before, it received a single loose span with no request around it.

Your own exporter for that same backend stops receiving those requests. If a team points `langfuse_otel` at its own project, your Langfuse project holds nothing for that team; exporters on other backends, a plain `otel` collector for instance, still receive everything.

The tenant's copy is stripped of your side of the request: the proxy's database endpoint, exception text and stack traces, an unreachable guardrail's error, and the query string on any URL.

If the tenant's backend is unreachable, its spans are not re-routed to your exporters. The point of the override is that you stop holding that team's traffic.

### Keep your own copy as well

Switch the mode to `additive` and your exporter keeps every request too, so an org-wide view stays complete:

```yaml
litellm_settings:
  otel_tenant_destination_mode: additive   # default: "override"
```

`LITELLM_OTEL_TENANT_DESTINATION_MODE=additive` does the same. When a team happens to name a project you already export to, the request is written once, not twice.

### Send a tenant to its own Langfuse host

`langfuse_host` on a key or team moves that tenant's traces to their own Langfuse server. Pass it with the key pair it belongs to, because a host on its own is ignored. Allowlist the host too, or the proxy logs a warning and leaves the request on your exporters:

```yaml
litellm_settings:
  provider_url_destination_allowed_hosts: ["langfuse.acme.com"]
```

Your own `LANGFUSE_HOST` needs no allowlist entry. The other presets take their endpoint from the proxy's environment; only the credentials vary per tenant, plus New Relic's region, picked from a fixed us/eu table.

### Send only the model calls to Langfuse

By default a Langfuse project, yours or a tenant's, receives the whole request tree: the HTTP request root, the auth step, database and cache lookups, every guardrail run, MCP tool calls, the model call and the spend write. If you only want the generations in Langfuse, set the scope to `llm_only`. The proxy keeps the model-call spans and stops forwarding every other span of that request to that Langfuse project. A model-call span is the one the proxy emits for each provider call it made on the caller's behalf, whatever the route: chat and text completions, Responses API calls, embeddings, image, audio and OCR generation, moderation, vector store calls and agent messages all count. They are the spans carrying `gen_ai.operation.name`, minus MCP tool calls. The generation keeps its trace id, so Langfuse still groups the generations of one request under one trace, and it keeps the caller's `langfuse.trace.name`, `user.id`, `session.id` and `langfuse.trace.tags`. Since the request root is no longer sent, that Langfuse project receives the generation as the root of the trace, and when the caller set no `langfuse_trace_name` or `metadata.trace_name` the trace takes the generation's own name, `chat claude-3-5-haiku` for instance, instead of showing up unnamed. Only that project's copy of the span is changed; a `full` project or a plain collector receiving the same request still sees the generation under the request span. When a tenant's `full` project is the same Langfuse account as your own `llm_only` exporter, that account gets the whole tree once and the generation stays in its place under the request span

A team or key sets it in its `langfuse_otel` callback next to its credentials:

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:4000/team/<team-id>/callback' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "callback_name": "langfuse_otel",
    "callback_type": "success",
    "callback_vars": {
      "langfuse_public_key": "pk-lf-...",
      "langfuse_secret_key": "sk-lf-...",
      "langfuse_span_scope": "llm_only"
    }
  }'
```

The Admin UI shows the same field as a `langfuse span scope` pick between `full` and `llm_only` next to the Langfuse OTEL credentials of a team or key

Your own Langfuse exporter has a separate switch in the proxy environment:

```shell
LITELLM_OTEL_LANGFUSE_SPAN_SCOPE=llm_only   # default: full
```

The two are independent. A tenant's `llm_only` narrows only that tenant's project, and the operator setting narrows only the exporter built from `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, whichever mode `otel_tenant_destination_mode` is in. Neither touches a plain `otel` collector or any other preset, so a Datadog or Grafana view of the same request stays complete. The accepted values are `full` and `llm_only`, and a key or team callback with any other value is rejected when it is saved. The setting applies to the `langfuse_otel` preset only: saving a `langfuse_span_scope` on a legacy `langfuse` callback or on another backend's callback is rejected as well, since nothing there would read it

Guardrail and MCP spans are dropped under `llm_only`, so a guardrail block that failed the request before any model was called leaves nothing in that Langfuse project. Keep `full` where you rely on Langfuse to see those

### Good to know

The key wins outright over the team. If a key has any `metadata.logging` entry, the team's callbacks are not consulted at all rather than merged with the key's, so a key that overrides one backend has to restate the others it still wants.

Credentials scope to the exporter their own preset contributed. A request carrying one tenant's Arize key never rewrites the headers of a co-configured Langfuse or self-hosted collector exporter, so a tenant's key cannot leak to a backend it was not meant for. Exporters on backends the tenant did not name do still receive the request's spans, with their own proxy-wide credentials.

The proxy caches one tracer provider per distinct credential set, up to 256 at a time, and flushes the least recently used one when it evicts. Tenant churn costs an exporter rebuild, not a lost span.

`os.environ/...` references are rejected in key and team `callback_vars`; pass the resolved value. Field names must be known callback params, and an unknown name fails the whole entry.

This routing applies to traces only. The GenAI client metrics (see [Metrics](#metrics)) always go to the proxy-wide exporter.


## Distributed tracing

If the incoming request has a W3C `traceparent` header, LiteLLM continues that trace instead of starting a new one. Your LiteLLM spans then appear inline inside whatever distributed trace your application already has, so you can follow a request from your app, through the proxy, to the LLM provider, in one view.

## Configuration reference

All values are environment variables. Boolean flags accept `true`/`false`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LITELLM_OTEL_V2` | `false` | **Master switch.** OTel v2 does nothing until this is `true`. |
| `LITELLM_OTEL_TENANT_DESTINATION_MODE` | `override` | `additive` keeps your own exporter's copy of a request a key or team routed to its own account. |
| `LITELLM_OTEL_LANGFUSE_SPAN_SCOPE` | `full` | `llm_only` sends just the model-call spans to your own Langfuse exporter. Tenants set theirs with `langfuse_span_scope` on the key or team. See [Send only the model calls to Langfuse](#send-only-the-model-calls-to-langfuse). |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER` (alias `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`) | `console` | Exporter kind: `console`, `otlp_http`, `otlp_grpc`. |
| `OTEL_ENDPOINT` (alias `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`) | none | OTLP collector URL. Setting an endpoint implies `otlp_http` unless you override `OTEL_EXPORTER`. |
| `OTEL_HEADERS` (alias `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`) | none | Comma-separated `key=value` auth headers for your backend. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `litellm` | `service.name` resource attribute shown in your backend. |
| `OTEL_ENVIRONMENT_NAME` | none | `deployment.environment` resource attribute (e.g. `production`). |
| `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` | `no_content` | Prompt/response capture: `no_content`, `span_only`, `event_only`, `span_and_event`. |
| `OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS` | health/metrics/UI routes | Comma-separated paths to exclude from tracing (substring match). Set to `""` to trace everything. |
| `LITELLM_OTEL_INTEGRATION_ENABLE_METRICS` | `false` | Also emit the GenAI client metrics (duration, token usage, cost, streaming timings). See [Metrics](#metrics). |
| `LITELLM_OTEL_LEGACY_COMPAT` | `true` | Also emit attributes under the older Traceloop key names. See [Attribute conventions](#attribute-conventions). |

The full set of keys on each span kind is in [Span attributes](#span-attributes).

## Troubleshooting

**No traces showing up?**

1. Confirm `LITELLM_OTEL_V2=true` is set in the proxy's environment.
2. Try `OTEL_EXPORTER="console"` first. If spans print to stdout, the problem is your exporter endpoint/headers, not LiteLLM.
3. Make sure you hit an LLM route (e.g. `/v1/chat/completions`). Health checks and UI routes are excluded by default.
4. Check that `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi` is installed (see Requirements).

**Only see the LLM call but no `auth`/`postgres`/server span?** Those server and DB spans require the FastAPI instrumentation package, so install `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`.

**I see metadata but no prompts/responses.** That's the default. Set `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=span_only` to capture content.
